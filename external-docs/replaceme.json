Working in challenging areas of computer science for twenty years, Robin Milner has the distinction of establishing an international reputation for three distinct and complete achievements, each of which has had and will continue to have a marked, important, and widespread effect on both the theory and practice of computer science: 1.\tLCF, the mechanization of Scott's Logic of Computable Functions, probably the first theoretically based yet practical tool for machine-assisted proof construction. 2.\tML, the first language to include polymorphic type inference together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism. 3.\tCCS, a general theory of concurrency. In addition, he formulated and strongly advanced full abstraction, the study of the relationship between operational and denotational semantics. A key ingredient in all of his work has been his ability to combine deep insight into mathematical foundations of the subject with an equally deep view of the key engineering issues, thus allowing the feedback of theory into practice in an exciting way. Further, his style of scholarship, rigor, and attention to aesthetic quality sets a high example for all to follow.  ",

Smalltalk was the first complete dynamic object-oriented programming language and development environment. It included a complete visual programming environment that was revolutionary at the time, but is now conventional.Smalltalk's unification of objects and messages and its clear and simple foundation concepts have been widely influential. It represented a breakthrough in both language design and in programming metaphors, and thereby influenced the design of subsequent object-oriented languages like C++ and Java. Kay and his team of developers went on to use Smalltalk as a vehicle for teaching computing concepts at the elementary school level.Smalltalk was part of a larger reconceptualization of computing which contributed to the emergence of personal computing. Kay envisioned Smalltalk as part of a \"user-centered\" approach to computing, which also led to the development of one of the basic components of the graphical user interface, overlapping screen windows. And Kay, along with others at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, integrated these ideas into the earliest personal computer, the Xerox Alto. Kay's work and his concept of the \"Dynabook,\" or a dynamic book, inspired a generation of computer scientists and engineers, and helped lay the intellectual foundations for the personal computer revolution.

Statemate was designed and built between 1984 and 1986 by a team composed of David Harel, Hagi Lachover, Amnon Naamad, Amir Pnueli, Michal Politi, Rivi Sherman, Mark Trakhtenbrot, and Aron Trauring at Ad Cad, Ltd., which later became the R&D division of I-Logix, Inc. It has been available continuously since then in several increasingly sophisticated versions. Statemate had a fundamental impact on software and systems engineering. The ideas first appearing in Statemate underlie today's most powerful and most widely used tools in software and systems engineering. Before Statemate, graphical design notations supported by CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tools did not have formal foundations, could not execute models, and could not generate code that ran. They were like programming language environments without compilers and interpreters. In 1983, David Harel developed statecharts, a graphical language for finite-state machines. The language provided natural and easy-to-grasp abstraction features, such as hierarchy, parallelism, and aggregation, which facilitate human understanding of complex system behavior. Harel and Pnueli then identified the class of reactive systems, for which such behavioral aspects were most problematic. Reactive systems include concurrent and real-time systems, embedded systems, and interactive systems. Statecharts proved to be the right notation to model them. In early 1984, Harel, Lachover, and Pnueli, together with Ido Lachover, co-founded Ad Cad, Ltd., to build a CASE tool supporting statecharts. One of the group's first tasks was to figure out how to embed statecharts into a broader framework that would capture the structure and functionality of a large complex system. They devised two more diagrammatic languages: activity charts, to specify functionality, and module charts, to specify structure. The first version of Statemate was operational in 1986. A Statemate user could draw a model's artifacts, check and analyze them, produce documentation, and manage their configurations and versions. Most importantly, Statemate could execute the model's functional and behavioral descriptions and could automatically generate executable code. Statemate was the first real-world tool for model-driven system development (MDD). In the 1990s, statecharts were incorporated into the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the industry-standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, and the basis for many recent CASE tools.

Amir Pnueli made a major breakthrough in the verification and certification of concurrent and reactive systems with his landmark 1977 paper \"The Temporal Logic of Programs\"(1) which was a crucial turning point in the progress of formal methods for such systems. This paper triggered a fundamental paradigm shift in reasoning about the dynamic behavior of systems; the techniques it introduces have had extraordinary influence and proven to be of lasting value. His work has been characterized as the most important contribution to program verification in the last twenty years and it has set the agenda for research and practice in the area.Pnueli's work on temporal logic has been seminal. First, he focused on the ongoing behavior of programs rather than just their input/output behavior thereby introducing a powerful formalism for reasoning about programs. Second, by using temporal logic he made it possible to easily specify qualitative progress properties of concurrent programs without cumbersome timing details. Third, he recognized the value of carefully-chosen dedicated operators to deal with the temporal ordering of events and thereby establish a framework for reasoning about and mechanical verification of concurrent programs.Beyond his pure scientific achievements, Amir Pnueli, a Professor of Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, is also keenly aware of the problems of putting computer science methods into practice and has been instrumental in founding two Israeli software firms. His work has influenced a large number of diverse industrial applications such as the process control of chemical plants, rule languages in active database systems, and the detection of complex race conditions in cache coherence protocols of computer architectures. By introducing temporal logic to computer science, Amir Pnueli has made a significant and lasting contribution which has been instrumental in shaping the study of concurrent systems.(1) Proc. 18th IEEE Symp.

Hashing is one of the fundamental techniques in computer science: generating challenging theoretical questions as well as finding application in almost all fields of computer science. In many of these applications a refined form of hashing is required, where keys that are close in the original space are more likely to be mapped to the same hash value. This is the problem that locality-sensitive hashing addresses. As a result similarity search problems can be solved in the hashed space instead of the original space, leading often to significant improvements either in efficiency or quality. Motivated by the need to efficiently compute near-duplicate web pages, Andrei Broder introduced specific locality-sensitive hash functions, called minhash functions, and used them to estimate the similarity of sets. Piotr Indyk and the late Rajeev Motwani extended locality-sensitive hash functions to a wider range of distance functions and showed how to use them to design approximate nearest neighbor algorithms with sub-linear query time. Moses Charikar subsequently introduced a highly efficient family of locality-sensitive hash functions, called simhash functions, for angular distances as well as a new variant of the nearest neighbor search algorithm. Locality-sensitive hashing techniques have been widely used in many fields of computer science including computer vision, databases, information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, and signal processing. Furthermore, they have inspired the development of other hashing-based methods for similarity search such as parameter sensitive hashing, semantic hashing, spectral hashing, and kernelized LSH. The work has also enabled other significant theoretical developments. In particular, it has led to the design of nearest neighbor algorithms for more complex metric spaces that play an important role in various applications. It has also resulted in new discoveries in, and connections to, other areas such as vector quantization, communication complexity, and streaming algorithms.  ",

Andrew Yao gave the first convincing definition of a pseudorandom number generator; namely that its output sequences are not distinguishable from those of a truly random generator by any polynomial-time test. He proved that any generator satisfying the next bit test developed by Blum and Micali satisfied his definition, and showed that the discovery of any one-way function would lead to such a pseudorandom generator.Dr. Yao introduced the important concept of communication complexity, which measures the minimum amount of interaction that two or more parties must have to jointly carry out some computation. He thus captured the essence of communication cost for distributed computation. His many contributions to complexity theory include proving the first exponential lower bound for the computation of an explicit function by a bounded-depth circuit. He has made seminal contributions to computational geometry, analysis of data structures, and quantum computing and communication. ",

Herbert Ballou University Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. Professor van Dam was a founder of that department, and its chair for nine years. After introducing computer science to high schools in 1962, in 1968 he helped form the standard ACM university curriculum. He pioneered the electronic classroom, and the use of animation and hypermedia for teaching. His former students are department chairs at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, the University of Washington, and the University of Waterloo, as well as leaders in industry. All five of his eligible students have National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigators Awards.   Professor van Dam has held thirty consultancies, authored or co-authored five books and eighty papers and given one-hundred and fifty invited lectures. His graphics text is the standard in the field. He is a founder of ACM SIGGRAPH.   van Dam has been an international leader in the development of undergraduate and graduate curricula in computer graphics, his principal research area. He has fostered innovative teaching methods at Brown not only in computer science, but in the application of computing technology in other disciplines. His personal investment in Brown students - particularly undergraduates - over nearly three decades has yielded an enormous pool of people who have followed in his footsteps as educators, researchers and developers.   Through his research interest in \"computer books,\" van Dam has developed systems that promote the connectivity of ideas and aid in the search for and creation of information. He collaborated with Ted Nelson to produce an early prototype of hypertest to explore ideas of nonsequential reading and writing. A version of his WYSIWYG hypertext editing system was installed in the Brown library more than twenty years ago and was used to each poetry classes in the English Department. His Interactive Graphical Documents system was a very early hypermedia system, combining graphics and animation with text.   van Dam produced generations of students who left Brown genuinely excited both about computer science and about computer science education.

Barbara Grosz's contributions to natural language processing center around the nature of discourse structure in language. Her research shows how discourse has identifiable structure at least as rich as that found at the sentence level, demonstrating the influence of discourse structure on such varied phenomena as forms of reference, intonational patterns, syntactic form, and cue-phrase selection. Within the area of multi-agent systems, Professor Grosz's research centers around the development of conceptual and architectural constructs that support joint action in multi-agent collaboration. She has contributed theoretical results as well as implemented systems, such as Colored Trails, that have been adopted by many others for their research. This work is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and results from economics, philosophy, psychology, and core computer science. Professor Grosz has played a leadership role within the field of artificial intelligence, serving as AAAI President, IJCAI Chair, and on the governing board of AAMAS. She has also had a profound effect on interdisciplinary institutions with which she has been affiliated. She was a co-founder in 1983 of the Center for the Study of Language and Information, a joint effort of Stanford University, SRI, and Xerox PARC, which became a premier institution in the interdisciplinary areas of computational linguistics and symbolic systems. As the first dean of science at Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Grosz developed a highly successful science program that fosters engagements with scientific communities at Harvard and attracts leading laboratory scientists as well as theorists from all scientific fields and from all parts of the world to Radcliffe's fellowship program. As dean of the Radcliffe Institute, she has been working with faculty from other Harvard schools to build multidisciplinary collaborations crossing the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences.

The Venus operating system was an early example of principled operating system design. The CLU programming language was one of the earliest and most complete programming languages based on modules formed from abstract data types and incorporating unique intertwining of both early and late binding mechanisms. ARGUS extended many of the CLU ideas to distributed programming, and incorporated the first versions of nested transactions to maintain predictable consistencies. Other advances include solutions elegantly combining theory and pragmatics in the areas of decentralized information flow, replicated storage and caching of persistent objects, and modular upgrading of distributed systems. Her contributions have been incorporated into the practice of programming, thereby influencing many of the most important systems used today: for programming, specification, systems design, and distributed architectures.

Eiffel is a method of software construction and a language applicable to the analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of software systems. It assists developers in creating correct, easy to change software systems. A central feature is the support for Design by Contract, where each component is accompanied by preconditions and postconditions and invariants that define its behavior. Thus Eiffel adapts techniques from the theory of proving programs correct so that they can be applied by practitioners to all the stages of specifying, designing, implementing, and maintaining correct software. Based on object-oriented programming, Eiffel includes support for classes, which often correspond to abstract data types, and inheritance. Eiffel also supports many other features that are needed for creating complete solutions to complex programming tasks, including support for type conversions, exception handling, concurrency, and \"agents.\" The language is sophisticated in design but simple in presentation, syntactically forgiving yet semantically precise, object-oriented by intent while mindful of historically useful language constructs. Thus Eiffel has exerted considerable influence on other languages. It became an ISO standard in November 2006. With Eiffel as his vehicle, Bertrand Meyer has been instrumental in promoting the benefits of principled programming. His book entitled Object-Oriented Software Construction and his university courses and commercial seminars have informed and trained countless software professionals and students. While pioneering multiple programming concepts and features, Eiffel has enjoyed commercial success in financial, industrial and government sectors, with tools and services provided by Eiffel Software, founded by Dr. Meyer in 1985.

Butler Lampson has provided technical vision that has strongly shaped the distributed, personal computing environment as we know it today. During the 1970s and early 1980s when he was the technical leader of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Butler and his colleagues developed general principles that help define the personal computer/local network/server paradigm. They designed and built a variety of hardware and software systems according to this new paradigm. Taken together, these systems demonstrated solutions to the associated engineering programs, and proved that the new paradigm could be applied effectively and efficiently. Butler was the overall system architect of the Alto, the progenitor of today's personal computer with its bit-mapped display and mouse. Later, he led the design of the Dorado, an early high performance single-user workstation. His single-user Alto operating system relied upon distributed utilities cooperating across the Ethernet and PUP, the first internet architecture. Today, the Ethernet and interconnected networks are ubiquitous. The Juniper file system offered reliable, distributed file storage. The Grapevine name server showed how to deal with naming entities in a continuously changing network environment and how to authenticate users across a network in which global trust could not be assumed. Remote procedure calling was engineered to be an efficient technique, capable of supporting remote servers. Butler designed Bravo, the first mouse-based \"what you see is what you get\" editor to run on the Alto. He led the design and implementation of both the hardware and software for the EARS laser printer which performed at a rate and with quality comparable with that which followed commercially only many years later. Interpress, Xerox's device-independent document description language, is the direct precursor of PostScript, an almost universal standard today. The Mesa system implementation language and the Cedar programming environment explored notation and techniques for the engineering of distributed, concurrent software. Butler Lampson and the individuals he drew to work with him pioneered the personal workstation/local network/server paradigm that has eclipsed the terminal/mainframe paradigm. This work enabled the personal computer revolution. Butler's vision, his leadership and his many technical achievements --including contributions both before and after those cited above -- have profoundly influenced and advanced computing.  ",

Turing Award Committee. Yet his longest and deepest involvement has been as chair of the ACM Awards Committee-a program that has flourished in prestige and recognition worldwide during Kelly's 20-year stewardship (the last decade with James Horning as co-chair). Kelly stands among a very rare breed of ACM volunteers who have dedicated so many years to one ACM program. His success story and contribution to the success of ACM is unmatched. Kelly's generous efforts have shaped and defined ACM's Awards program. He was the tireless advocate in pursuit of a vision that ACM's Turing Award should be recognized as the \"Nobel Prize\" in computing. During Kelly's reign, not only has the esteem and visibility of the Turing Award rocketed globally, so too did the cash prize associated with it: from $1,000 two decades ago to $250,000 today. The ACM Fellows program, the Distinguished Member program, and the Senior Member program were all established during Kelly's tenure. Leading by example, he inspired these committees to exceed expectations and pursue their own collective visions. Kelly's unflagging devotion to ACM's Award Committee has left a lasting impact on the program, the Association, and all those fortunate enough to work alongside him.

All of today's personal computers with bit-map screens and graphical user interfaces descend directly from the Alto. In addition, he invented the snooping cache coherence protocols used in nearly all small-scale shared-memory multiprocessors, pioneered the design of high-performance, high-availability packet- or cell-switched local area networks in the AN1 and AN2, and designed the Firefly, the first multiprocessor workstation.

Dan Boneh's work was central to establishing the field of pairing-based cryptography where pairings are used to construct new cryptographic capabilities and improve the performance of existing ones. Boneh, in joint work with Matt Franklin, constructed a novel pairing-based method for identity-based encryption (IBE), whereby a user's public identity, such as an email address, can function as the user's public key. Since then, Boneh's contributions, together with those of others, have shown the power and versatility of pairings, which are now used as a mainstream tool in cryptography. The transfer of pairings from theory to practice has been rapid. Organizations now using pairings include healthcare, financial, and insurance institutions. Over a billion IBE-encrypted emails are sent each year. More generally, Boneh has made significant contributions to a broad range of applications in cryptography and computer security, including: anti-phishing tools, compact digital signatures, password protection, fingerprinting of digital content, electronic voting, spam filtering, and side-channel attack analysis. Boneh has also made seminal contributions in a variety of other areas, such as DNA computing and learning theory. ",

The Gamma Database Machine Project built a prototype parallel relational database system from 1984 to 1992 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Gamma ran on a cluster of commodity computers (initially Digital VAX 11/750s) connected using standard networking technology. The main contributions of Gamma include the design and implementation of multiple partitioning techniques (round-robin, range, and hash) for distributing the tuples of each relation across multiple machines and disks, along with parallel and pipelined algorithms for executing relational queries in such an environment. Especially relevant were the Gamma join algorithms, including parallel versions of the hybrid-hash join algorithm, the use of sampling techniques for detecting and resolving data skew, the use of bit-vector filters for improving join performance, and the design of novel data replication strategies to minimize the impact of node and disk failures. Through extensive benchmarking, Gamma was the first parallel DBMS to publish results demonstrating practical \"linear scalability\"; i.e., the ability to run the same query with the same performance on more and more data by simply adding hardware nodes. While never commercialized, the Gamma Project, through the numerous technical papers produced, had a profound impact on the database field by demonstrating that scalable performance could be achieved without the use of specialized hardware. Nearly all of the industry's successful, shared-nothing parallel database systems have utilized the ideas and algorithms developed and evaluated as part of the Gamma project. Such systems include IBM DB2 Parallel Edition, Informix Version 8, Tandem Non-stop SQL, Vertica, Netezza, DATAllegro (Microsoft), Greenplum, Aster Data, and ParAccel. Most of these products are directed at the data warehouse and business intelligence market, estimated by the Gartner Group at $30B per year. In addition, the parallel, partitioned, dataflow computational pattern that made Gamma so scalable is currently undergoing a resurgence in the context of general-purpose, scalable, data-intensive computing frameworks like MapReduce from Google and Hadoop from Yahoo.

Statemate was designed and built between 1984 and 1986 by a team composed of David Harel, Hagi Lachover, Amnon Naamad, Amir Pnueli, Michal Politi, Rivi Sherman, Mark Trakhtenbrot, and Aron Trauring at Ad Cad, Ltd., which later became the R&D division of I-Logix, Inc. It has been available continuously since then in several increasingly sophisticated versions. Statemate had a fundamental impact on software and systems engineering. The ideas first appearing in Statemate underlie today's most powerful and most widely used tools in software and systems engineering. Before Statemate, graphical design notations supported by CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tools did not have formal foundations, could not execute models, and could not generate code that ran. They were like programming language environments without compilers and interpreters.  In 1983, David Harel developed statecharts, a graphical language for finite-state machines. The language provided natural and easy-to-grasp abstraction features, such as hierarchy, parallelism, and aggregation, which facilitate human understanding of complex system behavior. Harel and Pnueli then identified the class of reactive systems, for which such behavioral aspects were most problematic. Reactive systems include concurrent and real-time systems, embedded systems, and interactive systems. Statecharts proved to be the right notation to model them. In early 1984, Harel, Lachover, and Pnueli, together with Ido Lachover, co-founded Ad Cad, Ltd., to build a CASE tool supporting statecharts. One of the group's first tasks was to figure out how to embed statecharts into a broader framework that would capture the structure and functionality of a large complex system. They devised two more diagrammatic languages: activity charts, to specify functionality, and module charts, to specify structure. The first version of Statemate was operational in 1986. A Statemate user could draw a model's artifacts, check and analyze them, produce documentation, and manage their configurations and versions. Most importantly, Statemate could execute the model's functional and behavioral descriptions and could automatically generate executable code. Statemate was the first real-world tool for model-driven system development (MDD). In the 1990s, statecharts were incorporated into the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the industry-standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, and the basis for many recent CASE tools.

Dr. Harel, who works in computability and complexity, program logics, database theory and system specification, has been called that \"rare animal: the well- respected researcher who is able to communicate the essence of his work to a lay audience.\" He has used this ability throughout his career to promote computer science and computer science education.   In 1984-85, he delivered a widely acclaimed series of popular lectures on the fundamentals of computer science on an Israeli national radio channel. In the past ten years, he has given over 350 lectures of a popular and expository nature, explaining to people from all field the essence of topics such as system design, algorithms, computational complexity, NP-completeness, cryptography and undecidability.   Dr. Harel has devoted a great deal of his time to furthering computer science education. He has served as the youngest member of the Israeli National Council of Higher Education. He is a force on the Israeli Ministry of Education Committee on Computer Science, which is preparing a completely new curriculum for high-school computer science studies. And he has been instrumental in the development of new courses at the Open University of Israel.   Dr. Harel's crowning educational achievement is his book Algorithmics, the Spirit of Computing (1987), an exposition for the lay reader of the fundamental concepts of computer science. Without sacrificing intellectual integrity, Algorithmics conveys to the general reader basic notions of algorithms and their analysis, computability and complexity, probabilistic algorithms, concurrency, cryptography, and other important areas of computer science. Algorithmics is helping the world to reach a better understanding of computer science.   ",

David Blei is a leader in the area of large data analysis through machine learning. One of his central contributions is the rigorous treatment of the area of topic modeling, wherein a large data set is mathematically decomposed into latent themes. His approach is based on hierarchical Bayesian models using hidden variables, together with efficient computational methods for estimating model parameters. This work has inspired the work of many others, resulting in new research programs, workshops, and graduate courses. Blei is especially well known for his leadership on the landmark paper (with Jordan and Ng) on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This work has been cited thousands of times and is used in a range of applications including document summarization, indexing, genomics and image database analysis.

His excellence in teaching has served several generations of computer scientists at the University of California directly, and his computer architecture textbooks have served a broader audience. Over the years Dr. Patterson has maintained a high level of professional service. He served on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC); was a Board Member and then Chair of the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA); served on the National Research Council's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board; and was recently President of the ACM. In each of these roles he has a record of significant accomplishments. As President of ACM he created six major initiatives in the areas of research funding, offshoring, publicity for ACM, the health of professional conferences, high school education, and ACM member communication. As a member of the National Academy of Engineering's Membership Committee, Dr. Patterson has highlighted the contributions of other outstanding computing researchers, thereby increasing the number of computer scientists annually elected to the NAE.

It is hard to conceive of a professor who has done more for the advancement of education in computer science and engineering than Professor Patterson. Through his pioneering work on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing), Professor Patterson has gained national and international recognition as a leader in the advancement of computer technology. But what is equally important is that he has played a major role as an expositor of his ideas through teaching, writing and lecturing.   Professor Patterson's teaching is a striking demonstration of the importance of the interaction between teaching and research. His technique of involving students in team projects to develop innovative computer designs has played a key role in the development of RISC. He led three generations of RISC courses and seminars, involving students in each step of the design, fabrication and testing of a micro computer-on-a-chip. The RISC project not only produced a profound impact on computer technology, it also resulted in a whole generation of academicians. Ten of the participating students have joined academic departments and some of the lead students on the project have won other ACM awards for distinguished dissertations.   He also developed a novel approach to bring more computer science education to non-CS majors at Berkeley. He has transferred his success to other institutions through a textbook that he co-authored with his teaching assistants, Computing Unbound: Using Computers in the Arts and Sciences and its accompanying laboratory manuals.   His latest educational initiative is in his own field, computer architecture. He has co-authored the text Computer Architecture: A Quantitive Approach, and has made videotapes of his lectures available at cost to other universities.   In summary, Professor Patterson is a quintessential exampled of a professor who combines highest intellectual ability and technical expertise with a total dedication to his role as a teacher, mentor, and friend of his students.

Dina Katabi's dissertation work on the explicit Control Protocol (XCP) is one of the most important contributions in the area of network congestion control. It has introduced theoretical methods \u0013 in particular, stability analysis from control theory \u0013 to the design of scalable practical network protocols. Such protocols aim to minimize network congestion, thereby maximizing utilization efficiency, while ensuring a fair allocation of capacity among different flows that compete for the same bandwidth. Katabi's XCP was the first protocol to achieve both goals simultaneously without imposing the impractical requirement that routers maintain per-flow state. Her innovation is based on the novel and theoretically justified observation that congestion control mechanisms and capacity allocation among flows can be addressed separately. She designed an ingenious packet-marking scheme to carry information about network congestion and used methods from control theory to show that her algorithm provided a stable solution \u0013 for suitable values of the algorithm's parameters \u0013 to the delayed-feedback control problem defined by this scheme. Her work thus solved an important practical problem in a novel and rigorous way while opening up hitherto unexplored connections between networking and control theory. Katabi's research on XCP initiated a new approach to network protocol design and is essential reading for current courses in the area. Her ideas have impacted many subsequent protocols and computer systems. Perhaps more importantly, by changing the way we think about the algorithmic control of network behavior, Katabi's work is likely to impact future Internet developments to an even greater extent.

Hashing is one of the fundamental techniques in computer science: generating challenging theoretical questions as well as finding application in almost all fields of computer science. In many of these applications a refined form of hashing is required, where keys that are close in the original space are more likely to be mapped to the same hash value. This is the problem that locality-sensitive hashing addresses. As a result similarity search problems can be solved in the hashed space instead of the original space, leading often to significant improvements either in efficiency or quality. Motivated by the need to efficiently compute near-duplicate web pages, Andrei Broder introduced specific locality-sensitive hash functions, called minhash functions, and used them to estimate the similarity of sets. Piotr Indyk and the late Rajeev Motwani extended locality-sensitive hash functions to a wider range of distance functions and showed how to use them to design approximate nearest neighbor algorithms with sub-linear query time. Moses Charikar subsequently introduced a highly efficient family of locality-sensitive hash functions, called simhash functions, for angular distances as well as a new variant of the nearest neighbor search algorithm. Locality-sensitive hashing techniques have been widely used in many fields of computer science including computer vision, databases, information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, and signal processing. Furthermore, they have inspired the development of other hashing-based methods for similarity search such as parameter sensitive hashing, semantic hashing, spectral hashing, and kernelized LSH. The work has also enabled other significant theoretical developments. In particular, it has led to the design of nearest neighbor algorithms for more complex metric spaces that play an important role in various applications. It has also resulted in new discoveries in, and connections to, other areas such as vector quantization, communication complexity, and streaming algorithms.  ",

During this time, Dr. Barbara Simons has made valuable contributions to ACM in the public policy arena, and has demonstrated her leadership capacity several times. In 1987, Dr. Simons chaired ACM's Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights, which helped make ACM's voice heard on issues relating to the persecution of computing scientists outside of the United States. In subsequent years, she continued to be an activist in this arena with service on the ACM Committee on Public Policy, the SIGACT Science Policy Committee and SIGACT Vice Chair, the Computing Research Association's Public Policy Committee and, as Secretary of ACM, the Council and Executive Committee.  In 1993, Dr. Simons founded ACM's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM). As one of the endorsers of her nomination for this award wrote, \"forming USACM was, in itself, a pioneering idea, but Simons made sure the idea also was executed in a pioneering way...she recruited not only scientists and industry-based technologists who care about technology policy issues to serve on the committee, but also lawyers, law professors, and others in the academic world who wanted to make a positive contribution to technology policy.\" Through Dr. Simons' leadership as USACM's founding chair, and subsequently as ACM President and more recently USACM co-chair, USACM has provided a forceful, effective voice for ACM and the computing community. It has provided cogent advice and analysis to legislators and other policy makers about such wide-ranging issues as cryptography and computer security policy, privacy and intellectual property legislation, and funding for basic science and computing research.  Dr. Simons had the vision and the talent to make ACM successful in the public policy arena. She inspired and persuaded other talented people to make commitments to important projects in this area.

Vardi, Pierre Wolper For the development of automata-theoretic techniques for reactive-systems verification, and the practical realization of powerful formal-verification tools based on these techniques.  A key problem in computer science is finding ways to verify that hardware and software designs meet their specifications. This problem is particularly acute in reactive systems, which are systems that interact with their environments, such as digital systems and communication protocols. The four awardees demonstrated that checking the correctness of reactive systems can be done based on a mathematical analysis of automata. Specifically, questions about correctness of reactive systems with respect to expressive specifications can be reduced to questions about finite automata on infinitary input structures. They showed how this approach enables the development of algorithms that could be made efficient enough to automate reasoning in practice. Carrying out the automata-theoretic approach required advances in both automata theory and the theory of program logics. This connection brought a wealth of new techniques to the theory of program logics, and the new application revived the theory of automata on infinitary inputs. Their body of work provided the algorithmic foundations for many formal-verification tools. Furthermore, they were personally involved in the development of industrial verification tools via technology transfer and the development of the verification systems COSPAN and SPIN. Their techniques are widely used commercially in the development of \"control-intensive\" software programs.  ",

Barbara Ericson directs the \"Institute for Computing [email&#160;protected] Tech,\" and Mark Guzdial is the Director of the Contextualized Support for Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Together they have written three textbooks using the Media Computation approach, and Ericson has written a fourth book on using Media Computation with Alice. The media computation contextualized approach to introductory CS is now used in nearly 200 schools around the world. Their approach has students writing programs that manipulate and create digital media, such as pictures, sounds, and video. Ericson and Guzdial have taught hundreds of high school and college teachers how to teach with Media Computation across the US and in workshops in Sweden and New Zealand.  The origin of this work was Guzdial's realization that non-computer science students, and some computer science students, were not motivated by the classical algorithmic problems addressed in the traditional introductory computer science approach. This was evident by observing the high national failure rates in introductory CS courses. Guzdial's goal was to develop a better approach, to demonstrate that it really was a better approach, and then to spread the use of that better approach. This led Guzdial to develop JES, the Jython Environment for Students, which has now been used by thousands of students in introductory CS courses. The result is that the rates at which students successfully completed these courses with a passing grade rose significantly.  Ericson and Guzdial are also PIs on an NSF-funded statewide alliance \"Georgia Computes!\" which is focused on increasing the number and diversity of computing students in the state of Georgia. A common theme throughout the alliance's efforts is the use of contexts, like MediaComp, to engage and inspire student learning in computing.  Ericson also led the efforts in Georgia in having a high school computer science curriculum, having a computer science teaching endorsement, and counting the Advanced Placement in Computer Science course towards high school graduation requirements. In addition, Ericson's \"Operation Reboot\" was an innovative project that brought unemployed IT workers back into the workforce as high school computer science teachers, thereby helping current teachers become more knowledgeable about computing. While Ericson and Guzdial have worked both together and separately, they have done so working from a mutually-developed set of goals and methodologies.  ",

Allen Emerson and Joseph Sifakis, for their role in developing Model-Checking into a highly effective verification technology that is widely adopted in the hardware and software industries.  In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of Model Checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model--representing, for example, a hardware or software design--satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem. The progression of Model Checking to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past 27 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a result many major hardware and software companies are now using Model Checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits, communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms. The work of Drs. Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms, and surprising theoretical results. Model Checking tools, created by both academic and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance regarding the correctness of their initial designs.  ",

McMillan For their invention of symbolic model checking, a method of formally checking system designs, which is widely used in the computer hardware industry and is beginning to show significant promise also in software verification and other areas.   Model checking was invented in 1981 by Clarke and Emerson. This technique made it possible to algorithmically verify logical properties, expressed in a notation called temporal logic, of finite-state systems. Clarke and Emerson were able to use model checking to find some very subtle design errors in published hardware designs. The size of the state space was seriously limited, however, by the amount of available computer memory. In 1985, Bryant developed a new representation of Boolean functions, called OBDDs (Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams). Bryant's crucial contribution was to show that by fixing the order of testing of Boolean variables in binary decision diagrams, these diagrams become very tractable computationally. McMillan then realized that OBDDs can symbolically represent sets of states in state-transition systems. In 1987, he developed a software tool called SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier) with which systems with over 10^20 states could be verified, and symbolic model checking was born.   ",

Dijkstra - display, deadly embrace, semaphore, go-to-less programming, structured programming. But his influence on programming is more pervasive than any glossary can possibly indicate. The precious gift that this Turing Award acknowledges is Dijkstra's style: his approach to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; his eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into correctness; and his illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of program design. He has published about a dozen papers, both technical and reflective, among which are especially to be noted his philosophical address at IFIP, his already classic papers on cooperating sequential processes, and his memorable indictment of the go-to statement. An influential series of letters by Dijkstra have recently surfaced as a polished monograph on the art of composing programs. We have come to value good programs in much the same way as we value good literature. And at the center of this movement, creating and reflecting patters no less beautiful than useful, stands E.W. Dijkstra.

Eric Roberts has been a truly outstanding educator for decades, starting as the first computer scientist at Wellesley College in 1980. He has personally taught thousands of computer scientists, and reached many more through his textbooks and curriculum development. His textbooks are exemplary; the first, Thinking Recursively, was named in a 1998 CACM survey article as one of the core texts that every computer science educator should know. He built an organization of professional lecturers at Stanford that has become a model for effective teaching of computer science at universities across the country. Eric has shown exceptional leadership in computing education, made all the more effective because of the obvious priority he placed on being an outstanding educator. He devotes enormous time and energy to drawing attention to and addressing problems in our community, such as underrepresentation of women in computing and the need to devote more resources to computing education during times of enrollment surge. His principles and values have made him a respected voice in the computing education community. Eric\u0019s leadership is international in scope. He co-chaired the ACM Education Board for several years, and was one of the founding co-chairs of the ACM Education Council. From 1999 to 2005, he worked to develop a computing curriculum for public high schools in Bermuda. This program was the first national computing curriculum to be certified by an international standard board. Eric\u0019s work on Computing Curriculum 2001 exemplifies his leadership. He drew together diverse constituencies and stakeholders in a multi-year process. He was the principal author of the final report. The report is a significant intellectual achievement that has served educators around the world as they consider what every computing student needs to learn. ",

Fernando J. Corbat\u00f3 is a pioneer in the development of computer operating systems. At MIT's Computation Center and Project MAC, from 1960 to 1965, he spearheaded the development of CTSS (The Compatible Time-Sharing System), which was the earliest general-purpose, time-share operating system organized for utility-like use. The CTSS file system was the first to permit controlled sharing of files among users. Variants of the multilevel processor-scheduling algorithm devised by Corbat\u00f3 for CTSS are used in most of today's time-sharing systems. Corbat\u00f3 also led the development of Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Service), a joint effort of Project MAC, Bell Telephone Laboratories, and General Electric, from 1964 to 1969. Honeywell, which took over General Electric's role, later introduced Multics as a product, which still runs today. This system introduced many important concepts and techniques, including the hierarchical file system, Access Control Lists, Symbolic Naming, and Dynamic Linking, a close relationship between files and virtual memory, process structure and scheduling, and hardware-supported, ring-structured protection domains. The architectural concepts of Multics had a strong influence on many later systems, including the dynamic address translation and virtual systems capabilities of the IBM 370. The software organization of Multics likewise influenced the design of subsequent operating systems, most notably UNIX. The clock-based page-removal algorithm developed by Corbat\u00f3 for Multics is used in essentially all paged virtual memory systems today; the security features of Multics are still unexcelled. CTSS and Multics stand out not only as operating systems per se but as important early examples of large-scale software engineering. Multics was written almost entirely in a high-level language (PL/I); many software engineering techniques, such as information hiding through enforced abstractions, were pioneered during the development of Multics. These systems were the work of many people and served many people. Fernando Corbat\u00f3 coordinated the effort, provided a clear vision of an integrated shared computing utility, and made many technical contributions of lasting importance.  ",

Both alone and in joint work with John Cocke, she introduced many of the abstractions, algorithms, and implementations that laid the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology. Allen's 1966 paper, \"Program Optimization,\" laid the conceptual basis for systematic analysis and transformation of computer programs. This paper introduced the use of graph-theoretic structures to encode program content in order to automatically and efficiently derive relationships and identify opportunities for optimization. Her 1970 papers, \"Control Flow Analysis\" and \"A Basis for Program Optimization\" established \"intervals\" as the context for efficient and effective data flow analysis and optimization. Her 1971 paper with Cocke, \"A Catalog of Optimizing Transformations,\" provided the first description and systematization of optimizing transformations. Her 1973 and 1974 papers on interprocedural data flow analysis extended the analysis to whole programs. Her 1976 paper with Cocke describes one of the two main analysis strategies used in optimizing compilers today. Allen developed and implemented her methods as part of compilers for the IBM STRETCH-HARVEST and the experimental Advanced Computing System. This work established the feasibility and structure of modern machine- and language-independent optimizers. She went on to establish and lead the PTRAN project on the automatic parallel execution of FORTRAN programs. Her PTRAN team developed new parallelism detection schemes and created the concept of the program dependence graph, the primary structuring method used by most parallelizing compliers. In addition to her many contributions to research and practice, throughout her career Fran Allen has been an inspirational mentor to younger researchers and a leader within the computing community.

Blaauw, Computer Architecture: Concepts and Evolution, documents and exemplifies the power of their 1960's innovation of thinking about computer design as separable domains: architecture, implementation, and realization.Similarly, many of the technical innovations found in OS/360 - such as the approach to I/O handling and the method of transition between supervisor and user modes - are foundations of today's operating systems. Even more influential, though, is the distillation of the successes and failures of the development of OS/360 that Dr. Brooks captured in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering. Today ' twenty-five years, two editions, and 300,000 copies later - this book remains a defining work in the field of software engineering.In 1965, Dr. Brooks left IBM to found the Computer Science Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, his research on real-time three-dimensional computer graphics has propelled that field forward, driven by the goal of creating tools to enable scientists and engineers to tackle problems formerly beyond their reach. He and his students built the first molecular graphics system on which a new protein structure was solved. They also first proved that haptic displays augmenting visual displays can significantly improve a scientist's understanding of data. ",

Within CSE, he pioneered early computer development, then for IBM managed the development of the hardware and software for System/360, a landmark for its time that still influences the computer field today. He led the development of innovations in computer graphics and the application of computer graphics to the visualization and manipulation of biochemically important molecules.   The ACM Allen Newell Award was established to recognize both career interdisciplinary contributions and career breadth of contributions to Computer Science. Both were characteristics of the career of the great computer scientist after whom the award is named.   It is fitting that the first ACM Allen Newell Award be made to another great computer scientist, Professor Fred Brooks of the University of North Carolina. His career has included major contributions to the hardware and software most used in the computer world for two decades: the System/360 hardware and software. Working for IBM, he was the manager for the development of this hardware and software. He also made important architectural contributions to the pioneering Harvest and Stretch computers.   In Computer Science, he led the invention and engineering many of the methods and tools of computer graphics. This work on computer graphics was done in the context of displaying and manipulating visual models of complex molecules of importance to Biochemistry. The visualization tools he helped to develop are now standard tools in Biochemistry.   He is the author of the extremely influential book, The Mythical Man Month: Essays in Software Engineering, and the equally influential essay \"No Silver Bullet.\"   Professor Brooks is a winner of the National Medal of Technology, the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, and many other high honors in Computer Science and Engineering. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has served the national with the distinction on the National Science Board and the Defense Science Board.   ",

Randomized algorithms for testing whether a number is prime were introduced by Robert Solovay and Volker Strassen and by Michael Rabin. Each of these tests is based on an efficiently computable predicate depending on n, the number being tested for primality, and an integer b in the range [2, n]. In each case, the chosen predicate has the property that, if n is prime, then the predicate must be true for all b; therefore, a value b for which the predicate is false is a witness to the compositeness of n. Solovay and Strassen (1977) proved that, if n is composite then, for their predicate, at least half the possible choices of b are witnesses to its compositeness. Rabin (1980), using a different predicate, proved that, if n is composite then a least three-quarters of the possible choices of b are witnesses (for both predicates, typically, the fraction of witnesses is even higher than the general bound). Thus, an algorithm based on evaluating one of these predicates for a sequence of independent random choices of b never declares a prime number to be composite, and the chance of incorrectly declaring a composite number to be prime decreases exponentially with the number of random choices.   The predicate used by Rabin was previously employed in a 1976 paper by Gary Miller to construct a deterministic primality testing algorithm that runs in polynomial time assuming the validity of the extended Riemann hypothesis.   The Solovay-Strassen and Miller-Rabin tests demonstrate the power of randomized algorithms and make it possible to generate large random prime numbers and thus construct candidate instances of the RSA cryptosystem. Essentially all cryptographic systems being considered today require the generation of large primes. Of the two tests, the Miller-Rabin test is the more efficient in practice. It is included in many cryptographic products and is specified in many cryptographic standards such as the ANSI X9.80 Standard.   ",

He has authored many technical research papers, and he was recently elected a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. However, what is truly impressive is how many of Professor Sussman's research contributions ultimately find their way into both the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, such as his work on constraint-propagation models of electrical networks, and non-deterministic pattern matching implementations of logic programming.   Professor Sussman has also done significant pioneering work in introductory computer science education. Among his extensive contributions to education are two - the Scheme programming language and the textbook (co-authored with Harold Abelson) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - that have helped educators reshape introductory courses. These ideas have provided a formal framework for presenting the fundamental principles of computer science at hundreds of colleges and universities in the United States and around the world.   ",

Hal Berghel's contributions to ACM and the computing profession are as multi-faceted and energetic as his research. Hal was the driving force in creating the ACM SIG on Applied Computing and its associated journal. His major role in the ACM Technology Outreach Program (TOP) began with the revitalization of the ACM Lectureship Series which he then extended to Mexico and Central America. TOP has organized meetings around the world to assist in ACM chapter-formation activities, including India, Korea, Japan, China, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand. In all, nearly three dozen new chapters have been established as a result of this TOP initiative in the past 5 years. Hal also provided the motivation behind the first foreign language translation of an ACM periodical, Crossroads. Another form of innovation is illustrated by his development of the ACM Video Library and the Video Podium series. Further, Hal writes a regular column (Digital Village) in the Communications of the ACM and serves, in varying capacities, as a long-time member of the Publications Board. While Hal has been involved in many more activities than this sampling documents, it does convey something of the energy, zest and range of accomplishments that Hal brings to the profession.  ",

Dealing with multidimensional numerical data naturally arises in spatial, optimization, and learning problems. Accessing such information rapidly requires efficient and preferably elegantly simple data structures. If a distance metric can be associated to data, then spatial data structures may be used to index and to navigate data quickly and hierarchically. Such structures are ubiquitous in myriad areas, including databases, biomedical imaging, computer graphics and vision, geographic information systems, geometry, games, computational physics, and scientific computation. In his pioneering research since the 1980s on quadtrees and other data structures, as well as his well-received books, Prof. Hanan Samet has profoundly influenced the theory and application of multidimensional spatial data structures. His contributions to, and application of, incremental nearest neighbor search, metric navigation of spatial structures, and spatial data mining exemplify the breadth of his work, the impact of which can be seen in a wide array of practical applications. In addition to this body of work, his 1975 Ph.D. thesis on formal proofs of correctness of compilers, and the symbolic execution of compiled execution sequences, was among the earliest contributions to the field that twenty years later became known as translation validation for compilers.

The Boyer Moore Theorem Prover is a highly engineered and effective formal methods tool that pioneered the automation of proofs by induction, and now provides fully automatic or human-guided verification of critical computing systems. The latest version of the system, ACL2, is the only simulation/verification system that provides a standard modelling language and industrial strength model simulation in a unified framework. This technology is truly remarkable in that simulation is comparable to C in performance, but runs inside a theorem prover that verifies properties by mathematical proof. ACL2 is used in industry by AMD, IBM and Rockwell-Collins, among others.  Formal verification is of tremendous interest today in safety-critical applications such as embedded medical devices, spacecraft and aircraft control, and autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars. Because of the Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover, an enormous range of software programs and hardware designs are now amenable to formal verification, leading to safer and more secure software for all.  For use in the prover, Boyer, Moore, and Kaufmann pioneered and engineered many core verification technologies such as the integration of decision procedures, the use of meta-functions (reflection), and the tight integration of logic and programming. The Boyer-Moore specification logic caters for essentially arbitrary correctness properties, including partial and total correctness, safety, liveness, and security properties. Since the 1970s, Boyer, Moore and Kaufmann and the users of the Boyer-Moore theorem prover have continually re-defined the state-of-the-art by verifying actual running code, and demonstrating that theorem proving technology has reached the stage where commercial-scale applications are feasible.

We are in a new age of Internet-scale computing thanks in significant measure to the engineering innovations of Dean and Ghemawat.  Press Release ",

Through his books and students, Jeffrey Ullman has had a tremendous impact on computer science education. His book \"Principles of Database Systems\", first published in 1980, revolutionized the content of database courses at all levels, moving it from a purely engineering discipline to one with a firm theoretical foundation. Despite competition from many other database texts, this book (now in its third edition) is still the premier general graduate-level database textbook.   Others of his textbooks, some of which were jointly authored, have also helped define new areas, and have been considered the standard texts in those areas for many years.   The list of Ullman's Ph.D. students is truly remarkable. There are few universities, much less individuals, that have graduated so many distinguished computer scientists. Ullman's students have had, and continue to have, a profound impact on computer science in general, and on the database field in particular.   ",

The Gamma Database Machine Project built a prototype parallel relational database system from 1984 to 1992 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Gamma ran on a cluster of commodity computers (initially Digital VAX 11/750s) connected using standard networking technology. The main contributions of Gamma include the design and implementation of multiple partitioning techniques (round-robin, range, and hash) for distributing the tuples of each relation across multiple machines and disks, along with parallel and pipelined algorithms for executing relational queries in such an environment. Especially relevant were the Gamma join algorithms, including parallel versions of the hybrid-hash join algorithm, the use of sampling techniques for detecting and resolving data skew, the use of bit-vector filters for improving join performance, and the design of novel data replication strategies to minimize the impact of node and disk failures. Through extensive benchmarking, Gamma was the first parallel DBMS to publish results demonstrating practical \"linear scalability\"; i.e., the ability to run the same query with the same performance on more and more data by simply adding hardware nodes. While never commercialized, the Gamma Project, through the numerous technical papers produced, had a profound impact on the database field by demonstrating that scalable performance could be achieved without the use of specialized hardware. Nearly all of the industry's successful, shared-nothing parallel database systems have utilized the ideas and algorithms developed and evaluated as part of the Gamma project. Such systems include IBM DB2 Parallel Edition, Informix Version 8, Tandem Non-stop SQL, Vertica, Netezza, DATAllegro (Microsoft), Greenplum, Aster Data, and ParAccel. Most of these products are directed at the data warehouse and business intelligence market, estimated by the Gartner Group at $30B per year. In addition, the parallel, partitioned, dataflow computational pattern that made Gamma so scalable is currently undergoing a resurgence in the context of general-purpose, scalable, data-intensive computing frameworks like MapReduce from Google and Hadoop from Yahoo.

John Hopcroft's coauthored texts on formal languages and their relation to automata (1968) and on the design and analysis of algorithms (1974) gave direction to the field and set a standard for all to live up to. They were used throughout computer science academia for decades to teach students and faculty alike how one should think about theory and algorithms. Hopcroft has also been a prolific, influential, and inspiring PhD advisor, advising 30 PhDs in his first 30 years as a faculty member. His advisees learned how to do research from him, but they also absorbed his sense of discrimination, his standard of excellence, and his ideas on service to the community. In turn, many of them serve in influential positions in academia and industry ---among his PhD students are the president of an Israeli university, a MacArthur Fellow, a vice president of a computing research firm, and chairs of departments. Throughout his career, Hopcroft has helped the field by serving on innumerable national and international committees. The respect for his views and his work become evident when one considers that he has served on the National Science Board, which is the US science policy advisor to the President and the Congress, as well as several committees of the National Research Council.

Recommender systems have become ubiquitous. Whether shopping at Amazon.com, selecting videos at Netflix, or getting news and information, we have become accustomed to sophisticated personalization software that uses our preference data, together with the preference data of others, to provide personalized recommendations for content or products. Automated collaborative filtering, which launched the field of recommender systems in 1994, was introduced, refined, and commercialized by the team of John Riedl, Paul Resnick, Joseph A. Konstan, Neophytos Iacovou, Peter Bergstrom, Mitesh Suchak, Brad Miller, David Maltz, Jon Herlocker, Lee Gordon, Sean McNee, and Shyong (Tony) K. Lam through the GroupLens family of systems. The first generation GroupLens system (1994) was used to create personalized recommendations of Usenet news articles. The second generation (1995-1996) also targeted Usenet news articles, and led to the commercial launch of Net Perceptions, spawning what is now a vibrant recommender systems industry. After commercialization, the team launched MovieLens in 1997. MovieLens, a web-based research platform still operating today, has been used by more than 100,000 users; its online experiments and published datasets have led to hundreds of published advances in the field of recommender systems. Prior to GroupLens, most personalization systems were based entirely on building profiles of content preferences, and then applying them to new content. While this technique worked when interests were topical (e.g., choosing news about a favorite football club), they did not handle less feature-based preferences or distinguish among topical items by quality or taste. In 1992, Xerox PARC's Tapestry project introduced the term and concept \"collaborative filtering\", creating a centralized database where annotations could be stored and retrieved, but application of this idea was limited by the need to manually form queries and explore the database. The GroupLens team introduced automation to the process, which proved to be the fundamental breakthrough that enabled wide-ranging research and commercial applications. Through the founding of Net Perceptions, GroupLens had an enormous impact on e-commerce and information portals. Early customers, including Amazon.com, CDnow, and Art.com, demonstrated that the software generalized to a wide variety of domains, and validated the usefulness of collaborative filtering recommendation through explicit and implicit user ratings . Net Perceptions grew to become a $1 billion company, providing recommender systems to leading retail and information companies around the world. Recommender systems grew into an extensive research field, drawing from machine learning, human computer interaction, ecommerce, information retrieval, databases, and other areas of computer science. ACM's annual Recommender Systems Conference brings together leading researchers and practitioners. The field was recently energized by the $1 million Netflix Challenge. ",

Joe Halpern's investigations into the logics of knowledge, belief, probability, and causality have had a major impact in artificial intelligence, computer science, game theory, economics, and the philosophy of science. His work addresses the fundamental question of what information states are attainable by communicating agents. The insights from this groundbreaking research have, for instance, radically changed our understanding of what information states are (un)reachable by communicating agents, of how iterated knowledge and beliefs characterize the rationality of participants in a game, of how to model degrees of belief rigorously when the background knowledge includes both uncertain and certain propositions, leading to a statistically sound model of default reasoning; and of how to model causality and degrees of responsibility and blame. Professor Halpern has not only led the way linking scientifically multiple fields, but his example has been followed by many other researchers leading to the current thriving interactions between knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, applied logic, theoretical computer science, and game theory. His leadership goes back to founding the conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge, which continues to bring together researchers in AI, computer science, game theory, philosophy, and linguistics, and continues through the education of students and other researchers in how to translate between the languages and methods of different disciplines. As a member of the ACM Publication Board, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACM, and founder of CoRR (the Computing Research Repository), Professor Halpern has also played a leading role in increasing access to scientific publications in all areas of computer science.

Much of the way ACM operates today is rooted in the decade that Joseph S. DeBlasi served as its Executive Director (1989-1999). Under his leadership, ACM was transformed from a society dependent on revenue from a declining external source to a financially viable organization that established reserve funds for continued program support, promoted revenue sharing among SIGs and other ACM groups, and established sources of funding from industry in support of ACM programs. DeBlasi also laid the foundation for ACM headquarters to be viewed as the central hub of the organization, empowering and inspiring a staff of professionals to develop many of the products and services appreciated today by members worldwide.  DeBlasi was one of the champions of the Association's premiere product: the ACM Digital Library. Indeed, he is credited for constructing one of the first real business plans for a digital library.  He supported the Distinguished Lecturer Program (the precursor of the Distinguished Speakers Program) that provided ACM student chapters with access to outstanding speakers. He made the issues of women in computing a priority by increasing the visibility of female leaders in the field. And he saw unlimited potential in a growing cyberspace. As a result ACM was one of the first scientific organizations to offer permanent email addresses and Internet connectivity services for members.  Moreover, DeBlasi saw the future in students. He took up the fledgling Scholastic Programming Contest and breathed new life into the venture. The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest continues to draw worldwide attention to the Association as well as corporate sponsorship by IBM. The payback to ACM in student membership and global acceptance has been nothing short of remarkable.  ACM is in a far better place to meet the future thanks to the tireless efforts of Joseph S.

Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of Model Checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model--representing, for example, a hardware or software design--satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem. The progression of Model Checking to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past 27 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a result many major hardware and software companies are now using Model Checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits, communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms. The work of Drs. Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms, and surprising theoretical results. Model Checking tools, created by both academic and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance regarding the correctness of their initial designs.  ",

Subsequently, he collaborated with researchers in chemistry and artificial intelligence on a heuristic program (Heuristic DENDRAL) for hypothesizing chemical structures from physical spectral data. This work was the progenitor of the class of AI applications called expert systems, now the largest class of AI applications. He collaborated on the landmark Meta-DENDRAL learning program for interring some elements of the theory of mass spectrometry from chemical data.   He continued the collaboration with AI scientists in the MOLGEN program, the first large-scale application of computer methods to molecular biology, thereby pioneering in an area that is now of great importance to science.   In the early 1970s, when interactive and networked computers were new, he envisioned a national networked community of investigators across the disciplines of computer science, medicine, and biology.

Judea Pearl's work has transformed artificial intelligence (AI) by creating a representational and computational foundation for the processing of information under uncertainty. Pearl's work went beyond both the logic-based theoretical orientation of AI and its rule-based technology for expert systems. He identified uncertainty as a core problem faced by intelligent systems and developed an algorithmic interpretation of probability theory as an effective foundation for the representation and acquisition of knowledge. Focusing on conditional independence as an organizing principle for capturing structural aspects of probability distributions, Pearl showed how graph theory can be used to characterize conditional independence, and invented message-passing algorithms that exploit graphical structure to perform probabilistic reasoning effectively. This breakthrough has had major impact on a wide variety of fields where the restriction to simplified models had severely limited the scope of probabilistic methods; examples include natural language processing, speech processing, computer vision, robotics, computational biology, and error-control coding. Equally significant is Pearl's work on causal reasoning, where he developed a graph-based calculus of interventions that makes it possible to derive causal knowledge from the combined effects of actions and observations. This work has been transformative within AI and computer science, and has had major impact on allied disciplines of economics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and statistics.  ",

Judea Pearl realized the overwhelming prevalence of uncertain information in real-world systems and developed a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for Artificial Intelligence based on probability theory. His influence outside AI has also been great. He forged links between computer science and statistics where none existed previously; his models are used to describe everything from the effects of diseases to the likely behavior of terrorists; and his ideas have revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine, and the social sciences.   Pearl has made pioneering contributions in several areas:   His 1984 book, Heuristics, tied together a broad array of work from several fields concerned with combinatorial problem solving and optimization. It contained much original work, including the use of formal tree models to analyze the relationship of search depth to decision quality; the first theorems relating the quality of heuristics and the complexity of search; and the discovery and analysis of admissible heuristics, which has led to marked improvements in the capability of modern planning software. His 1988 book, Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems, has been influential in shaping both the theory and the practice of knowledge-based systems. Pearl's methods helped establish probabilistic networks for representing uncertainty in computer systems. His work demonstrated that networks of cause-effect relationships can represent the qualitative aspects of probabilistic knowledge and that most computations can be performed in a distributed fashion within the topology of these networks. The effects of Pearl's innovations are apparent in both academia and industry. His work is among the most cited in the computer science literature and is largely responsible for creating the field of Uncertainty in AI.  His 2000 book, Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference, introduces causal networks, which refine the idea of Bayesian networks by modeling not just the uninterrupted operation of a stochastic system, but also the effects of all possible interventions. His contributions have had a major impact on the way causality is understood and measured in many scientific disciplines, most notably philosophy, psychology, statistics, econometrics, epidemiology, and social science. It is hard to identify a body of AI research that has been as influential on these related disciplines as has been Pearl's work on causality, culminating with his recent theories of causal discovery, counterfactuals, and interventions.

Gerhard Goos, Juris Hartmanis, and Jan van Leeuwen are eminent researchers who by example and by leadership in various research organisations helped establish computer science as a vibrant subject. This award recognizes in particular their service and contribution to the computer science community through their high quality editorship of the Springer Lecture Notes Series in Computer Science. Goos and Hartmanis started editing this series in 1973 and were joined by van Leeuwen some years later. This congenial team soon established the series as a stable, reliable, and highly visible platform for disseminating research results and insights from all areas of the then nascent field of computer science. LNCS was a highly important and influential publication platform at a time when researchers often worked in isolation, came from diverse backgrounds, and had few genuine computer science venues to call upon. Through the LNCS series Goos, Hartmanis, and van Leeuwen provided a widely read, well visited forum that supported the exploration of new areas, enabled the dissemination of ideas, and served as an initial platform for many a young researcher. With untiring enthusiasm Goos, Hartmanis, and van Leeuwen showed exceptional taste and prescience in identifying and nurturing new fields and talent. When they passed on the baton as chief editors of the LNCS series in 2004, the volume count had reached the staggering number of 3000, yet the quality and high standards of the LNCS series during their stewardship has proven difficult to match. The long-term effect of their able and dedicated service on the development of computer science cannot be exaggerated.  Press Release ",

While geometry allows us to discover properties of objects at once both subtle and profound, its fundamental principles are remarkably simple.  The implementation of geometric algorithms is in contrast extremely complicated, and fraught with the problem of finding a compromise among precision, robustness, data organization and computational complexity. Understanding thoroughly this theory-practice chasm requires both deep knowledge and experience. The fundamental difficulty of implementing geometric algorithms for many years impeded progress in areas such as computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design, scientific computation, and computational biology.  In the late 1980s, Kurt Mehlhorn, who was already distinguished for his work in theoretical computer science,and his former student Stefan N\u00e4her, recognized the need to make available a robust, practical and efficient set of combinatorial and geometric algorithms and their underlying data structures. They developed the collection \"Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms,\" or \"LEDA\" for short.  The development of freely available algorithmic software deeply affected the work of thousands of researchers in many disciplines, and it has been incorporated into the product development of hundreds of companies. Some aspects of LEDA have also been incorporated into CGAL, a multi-institutional open-source applied geometry initiative. Today, LEDA continues to be developed and refined through a novel distribution model that is free to researchers and licensed to companies. Mehlhorn has also developed mathematical methods to certify both the theoretical and practical correctness of algorithms and their implementation. He has supervised numerous students and published several books on algorithms and algorithm engineering.  ",

Over the past 30 years, Leslie G. Valiant has made fundamental contributions to many aspects of theoretical computer science. His work has opened new frontiers, introduced ingenious new concepts, and presented results of great originality, depth, and beauty. Time and again, Valiant's work has literally defined or transformed the computer science research landscape. Valiant's greatest single contribution may be his 1984 paper \"A Theory of the Learnable,\" which laid the foundations of computational learning theory. He introduced a general framework as well as concrete computational models for studying the learning process, including the famous \"probably approximately correct\" (PAC) model of machine learning. This has developed into a vibrant research area and has had enormous influence on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and many areas of computing practice, such as natural language processing, handwriting recognition, and computer vision. Valiant has made many seminal contributions to computational complexity. He introduced the notion of complexity of enumeration, in terms of the complexity class #P. The most surprising consequence of this study was that natural enumeration problems can be intractable even when the corresponding decision problem is tractable. Another fundamental contribution to computational complexity was Valiant's theory of algebraic computation, in which he established a framework for understanding which algebraic formulas can be evaluated efficiently. A third broad area in which Valiant has made important contributions is the theory of parallel and distributed computing. His design of randomized routing strategies laid the groundwork for a rich body of research that exposed how randomization can be used to offset congestion effects in communication networks. He proposed the bulk synchronous model of parallel computation. He also posed a number of influential challenges leading to the construction of parallel algorithms for seemingly inherently sequential problems. Finally, the superconcentrators constructed by Valiant in the context of computational complexity established the fundamental role of expander graphs in computation. Press Release  ",

Leslie Lamport originated many of the key concepts of distributed and concurrent computing, including causality and logical clocks, replicated state machines, and sequential consistency. Along with others, he invented the notion of Byzantine failure and algorithms for reaching agreement despite such failures. He contributed to the development and understanding of proof methods for concurrent systems, notably by introducing the notions of safety and liveness as the proper generalizations of partial correctness and termination to the concurrent setting. In addition, he devised important distributed algorithms and developed a substantial collection of formal modeling and verification methods and tools that have been used to improve the quality of real distributed systems. His contributions share a common theme: to impose clear and well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of a collection of distributed processes. They make it substantially easier for algorithm designers to design distributed algorithms, and for programmers to write distributed programs. ",

In her doctoral dissertation, Lydia Kavraki developed randomized path-planning algorithms for robots with many degrees of freedom. Traditional algorithms for such problems usually depend exponentially on the dimensionality of the problem and are thus impractical for problems with more than five degrees of freedom. Dr. Kavraki established the effectiveness of methods that combine randomization with local, problem-specific techniques for problems that simply could not be handled any other way. Establishing the effectiveness of the approach required both sophisticated and novel mathematical techniques as well as cutting-edge experimental work. This approach, now considered the method of choice and called the probabilistic roadmap approach, has since generated tremendous interest in many research centers around the world, and Dr. Kavraki's experimental results have been replicated by many other researchers.  Recently, Dr. Kavraki has extended her work in several directions. The first extension is the application of randomized path planning to model molecular docking in rational drug design. There are nice parallels between path planning in robotics and in drug design, but there are also significant differences. Her second extension is the treatment of flexible objects. Although this problem has been recognized for over a decade, Dr. Kavraki was the first to develop a rigorous planning model for flexible objects.  Dr. Kavraki's contributions have had a profound influence on the development of path planning techniques and are recognized for both their depth and breadth. Her work reflects a level of originality, rigor, and elegance that stands out in the research community.   ",

Matthias Felleisen has long been deeply invested in outreach and K-12 education. A visionary educator, he has worked on implementing and disseminating his vision for close to two decades. His curriculum, inspired by his and others' research on functional programming languages, introduces the \"design recipe\", which combines the beauty of mathematical discovery and the elegance of functional programming with the sophistication of pedagogically sound tools. This key innovation guides students from a blank sheet of paper to a complete program in a step-by-step manner and helps teachers diagnose their students' problems. Felleisen's books, \"The Little Lisper\" and its successor, \"The Little Schemer,\" co-authored with his PhD advisor, have been widely used for 25 years. His book \"How to Design Programs,\" co-authored with former students, features the design recipe and the principle of introducing data structures along the lines of set theory. His programming environment for teaching, DrScheme, incorporates the idea of pedagogical concepts of language levels, with each level matched to some state of the design recipe. These features allow the tool to provide much more helpful feedback and allows the teacher to enforce an important idiom before encouraging students to use a language feature in unanticipated ways. In 1995, Felleisen created the TeachScheme! outreach project. Over the past 15 years, the week-long summer TeachScheme! workshops have served hundreds of K-12 educators in the use of the design recipe, who in turn instructed thousands of students. In 2001, he helped undergraduates launch a student-to-student outreach, dubbed Bootstrap, which has spawned dozens of workshops across the nation. While these workshops appear to teach programming, they also help students see mathematics in a new light and help them understand how fun and entertaining mathematics and science can be. ",

Although the concept of virtualization was first explored in the 1960s in the context of mainframe computers, it languished until Mendel Rosenblum and his students at Stanford University rediscovered the idea as a simulation tool for new multiprocessor architectures. Realizing that virtualization could be used for actual execution and not just simulation, Rosenblum along with Diane Greene, Edouard Bugnion, Scott Devine, and Edward Wang founded VMware Inc. in 1998. Rosenblum, Bugnion, Devine, Wang, and VMware's first employee Jeremy Sugerman then designed and developed VMware Workstation 1.0 for Linux, bringing virtualization technology to the Linux desktop, and creating a vibrant industry and research area around the technology. VMware Workstation 1.0 spurred a shift to virtual-machine-based architectures, allowing users to efficiently run multiple operating systems on their desktops. In subsequent years, the virtualization technology first introduced by the awardees was adopted by large-scale data-center operators in order to increase the efficient and safe use of shared computational resources. The broad and growing use of virtualization since the release of VMware Workstation 1.0 has caused the leading vendors of the x86 processor family to modify their designs to directly support virtualization. In addition to opening an important industry segment in virtualization technology, VMware Workstation 1.0 began a period of exciting new research in the areas of operating systems, networking, and software engineering.

Michael I. Jordan has played a seminal role in the development of statistical machine learning. His work, and the work of his former students and postdocs, has served to define this area, which bridges computer science and statistics. Michael played a leading role in the development of the variational approach to inference in graphical models, identifying techniques in statistical physics that could provide efficient approximation algorithms for large-scale Bayesian networks. Michael and his colleagues developed the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for extracting topics from documents, which has proven very influential not only in text processing but in many other domains. He and his colleagues have also developed several important families of probability models, including the widely used hierarchical mixtures of experts, and the widely applicable hierarchical Dirichlet processes. These models have extraordinarily broad applications from robotics and computer vision, to text and natural language processing, to the detection of bugs in software, to statistical genomics and proteomics. Michael's work is not only highly influential in computer science, with broad applicability within and beyond the field, but also plays a major role in the increasingly computational nature of research in statistics. Michael has also served as a leader in the machine learning community, organizing conferences and workshops, including serving as general chair of the NIPS conference. He is known for working broadly with neuroscientists, statisticians, and biologists, not only in joint research but as an educator and ambassador. Michael has trained an incredible cohort of students and postdocs, distinguished both in size and quality, who now hold faculty positions in over a dozen of the world's top computer science departments and positions in many leading companies.

Michael Stonebraker has made fundamental contributions to database systems, which are one of the critical applications of computers today and contain much of the world's important data. He is the inventor of many concepts that were crucial to making databases a reality and that are used in almost all modern database systems. His work on INGRES introduced the notion of query modification, used for integrity constraints and views. His later work on Postgres introduced the object-relational model, effectively merging databases with abstract data types while keeping the database separate from the programming language. Stonebraker's implementations of INGRES and Postgres demonstrated how to engineer database systems that support these concepts; he released these systems as open software, which allowed their widespread adoption and their code bases have been incorporated into many modern database systems. Since the pathbreaking work on Ingres and Postgres, Stonebraker has continued to be a thought leader in the database community and has had a number of other influential ideas including implementation techniques for column stores and scientific databases and for supporting on-line transaction processing and stream processing.

Historically, cryptographic schemes used in practice were designed in ad hoc ways and subject to failure. Practice-Oriented, Provable-Security (POPS), developed by Bellare and Rogaway in a series of papers in the 1990s, changed this, giving us the means to create high-assurance practical cryptography, meaning schemes that were backed by the theoretical guarantee of provable security while meeting practical needs and expectations. Today, POPS-based schemes are cornerstones of Internet security, implemented in most communication security protocols and software - these schemes are used every time someone makes a credit card-based Internet purchase. Meanwhile, the models, techniques and approaches that Bellare and Rogaway introduced, including the random oracle model, have become the foundation of a new subfield of cryptography, inspiring a great amount of follow-on work. Their papers are amongst the most cited in cryptography and their work is discussed in dozens of textbooks. Bellare and Rogaway changed the perception of theory in practice. Prior to their work, practitioners ignored theory or were even antagonistic to it. Today, they not only choose to implement and standardize proven-secure schemes, but make provable security a requirement in some of their calls for algorithms. That this requirement can be met owes much to Bellare and Rogaway's work. ",

Revitalization of Communications of the ACM (CACM) In late 2006 Moshe Y. Vardi took on the task of revitalizing and redefining Communications of the ACM. His goal was to create a publication that reflected the very best of computing research, education, and practice. His approach was influenced by Science, the weekly publication of AAAS, which covers research, practice, news, and opinion for the broad scientific community. As Editor-in-Chief of Communications, Vardi added compelling features including viewpoints, practice, and research highlights, enabling the activity, contributions and insights of computing to be communicated through a variety of perspectives and contexts. He assembled a number of outstanding editorial board sections, each populated with distinguished computing professionals, and each focused on a specific area of the magazine: research highlights, practice, contributed and review articles, news and viewpoints. Communications, through Vardi's efforts, is now a publication of interest to practitioners, researchers, educators, and the educated public alike. The result is truly a flagship publication of ACM, and an effective communication vehicle for our discipline to the world at large. Outsourcing Study In early 2004 the issue of outsourcing and job migration was increasingly a concern to the computing community. There were questions as to what was really going on: Were jobs actually moving? Was there no future for IT professionals? What would be the long-term impact on academic/research communities? Funded by the ACM Council, and with the help of Frank Mayadas and William Aspray, Vardi assembled a 30-person international task force to look at the issue. In a yearlong effort, he guided the task force in a systematic, scientific analysis of the forces underpinning job migration. The result of this analysis was a widely-circulated report, Globalization and Offshoring of Software, which was released in February 2006. Vardi has helped lay the foundation for arguments that the entire computing field has embraced: that the world of computing is globalizing, that investment in computing research is fundamentally important to innovation, that the study of computer science is critical to competitive 21st century skill sets, and that strong educational systems in which computation plays a fundamental role will be defining success measures in a competitive global economy.

Vardi, Pierre WolperFor the development of automata-theoretic techniques for reactive-systems verification, and the practical realization of powerful formal-verification tools based on these techniques.  A key problem in computer science is finding ways to verify that hardware and software designs meet their specifications. This problem is particularly acute in reactive systems, which are systems that interact with their environments, such as digital systems and communication protocols. The four awardees demonstrated that checking the correctness of reactive systems can be done based on a mathematical analysis of automata. Specifically, questions about correctness of reactive systems with respect to expressive specifications can be reduced to questions about finite automata on infinitary input structures. They showed how this approach enables the development of algorithms that could be made efficient enough to automate reasoning in practice. Carrying out the automata-theoretic approach required advances in both automata theory and the theory of program logics. This connection brought a wealth of new techniques to the theory of program logics, and the new application revived the theory of automata on infinitary inputs. Their body of work provided the algorithmic foundations for many formal-verification tools. Furthermore, they were personally involved in the development of industrial verification tools via technology transfer and the development of the verification systems COSPAN and SPIN. Their techniques are widely used commercially in the development of \"control-intensive\" software programs.  ",

Dr. Leveson's work has influenced not only academic research but government standards and industrial practice world wide, spanning nuclear power, aerospace, medical, and various transportation systems. Dr. Leveson has built bridges between computer science and the fields of system engineering; mechanical, industrial and other engineering specialties; human factors and industrial psychology; organizational sociology; and formal accident theory.   Professor Leveson and her students established the basic definitions and formal foundations for the new field of software safety and developed techniques to identify software-related system hazards, eliminate and control hazards through system and software design. She has been concerned not only with technical issues but also with the managerial and organizational problems that lead to accidents in high-tech systems. Her book on software safety is used by practicing engineers in many engineering disciplines and in classes not only in computer science but in industrial, mechanical, and other engineering departments. Her contributions within computer science have been broad also and have spanned the areas of fault tolerance, software engineering, human-computer interaction, and formal methods.   Validating her great interdisciplinary contributions, the AIAA (American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 1994 awarded her their Information Systems Award for contributions in space and aeronautical computer technology and science. Throughout her career, she has been a vocal advocate for responsible engineering practices in the use of computers to control safety-critical systems and has raised consciousness about the ethical and moral issues involved in entrusting computers with responsibility for human life without adequate assurance that safety is not being compromised. Besides providing technical solutions to the problems involved in using computers, her detailed investigations of serious accidents have raised awareness among engineers and scientists of the potential dangers.

Professor Dale is a leader in the movement to promote empirical research in Computer Science education. Her careful experimental studies have been extremely influential, and her training of graduate students has extended her impact.   Professor Dale is known to students and educators around the world for her many successful textbooks. Her first textbook, \"Pascal and Structured Design\" broke new ground. Programming textbooks had, until then, focused on language syntax. Professor Dale moved the attention away from syntax to problem solving and software engineering principles, using them to motivate language constructs. Revolutionary at the time, this is now the standard model for computer science textbooks. With this and numerous subsequent successful textbooks, Professor Dale has reached many thousands of students, at both the undergraduate and high school level.   Professor Dale has also made a direct contribution to the training of Computer Science educators by organizing and leading conferences throughout the world for the preparation and development of high school and post-secondary educators.   Professor Dale is renowned by her students and colleagues as a wonderful mentor and role model. Her Women in Science program has improved the lives of many women by retraining them for successful careers in Computer Science. These women received outstanding instruction, guidance and support from Professor Dale, and have themselves recruited many other women into the discipline.   Professor Dale has had a \"large and direct influence on students and educators at all levels. She is a vital force in the Computer Science education community.\"   ",

His visionary emphasis on critical thinking and mathematical precision in Computer Science has dramatically changed the face of computer science education. This viewpoint is exemplified by his widely used textbooks on compilers, on the science of programming, and on mathematical foundations for computer science; by his role in curriculum development; and by his training of graduate students who have seeded his view as successful educators at other universities.   David Gries is the William L. Lewis Professor of Engineering at Cornell University. After a brief period on the faculty of Stanford, Professor Gries joined Cornell's faculty in 1969; he served as the chair of the Computer Science department for five years.   Professor Gries has authored or edited eleven books, as well as seventy articles. His 1971 textbook on compilers was the first in that area and set the standard for many subsequent years. It has been translated into five other languages and had an international impact on the teaching of compilers. His textbook (with R. Conway) on structured programming, which engendered four follow-on texts each geared towards different needs, has profoundly influenced several generations of computer science students. In particular, Professor Gries' books have championed the role of critical thinking and mathematical precision in all aspects of the teaching of computer science.   Professor Gries' impact on education reaches beyond his writings. He has played a central role in national curricula development committees; he has been a visible presence within national organizations in the discussion of future directions for computer science education; and he has educated a wealth of graduate students who now serve as senior faculty at major universities or as directors of major research laboratories. His colleagues at Cornell further note that Professor Gries often serves not just as a mentor for students at Cornell but as a mentor for his faculty colleagues as well. His commitment to excellence in education has dramatically influenced his own students, his colleagues, and the generations of students who have been exposed to his textbooks.   ",

Implementations of these protocols and conceptual framework have been deployed on scores of millions of machines and therefore enjoy daily impact.  Before the two papers by Robert D. Blumofe and Charles E. Leiserson, distributed scheduling involved various promising but ultimately fragile heuristic techniques built on the ideas of work queues and dataflow computation. The fragility meant that some programs might run efficiently, but slight changes in code or the environment could make execution far less efficient. The theoretical framework offered by the two papers showed that under certain eminently achievable circumstances, a simple randomized \"work-stealing\" algorithm, in which idle processors takes work from busy processors, can achieve essentially perfect parallel speedup. The impact of this work has been both rapid and widespread. Work-stealing schedulers can be found in Java, Microsoft Visual Studio, and state-of-the-art garbage collectors. The Cilk parallel programming framework, developed by the authors, is now directly incorporated within the Intel C/C++ compiler, GCC, and other compilers, thus increasing the range of application of these ideas to nearly ubiquitous platforms. Robert D. Blumofe is Executive Vice President of the Akamai Platform Division and is responsible for the deployment of Akamai networks, as well as for the distributed algorithms that run on them.

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. However, the rapid commercialization of the Internet in the last decade has put a significant strain on the interdomain-routing system. Unlike traditional routing protocols, BGP allows the operators of each domain to design policies for selecting paths to reach the Internet's many destinations and deciding which other networks may use these paths.  BGP offers significant flexibility in selecting policies, but these policies have (at best) an indirect influence on where the traffic goes. Jennifer Rexford's work has addressed these problems through deep understanding and innovation across Computer Science theory, networking protocols, Internet economics, and ISPs' operational practices.  Dr. Rexford's work with Lixin Gao was the first to recognize that business relationships in the Internet have a profound influence on the behavior of the underlying protocols. This work identified simple policy guidelines that ensure the global routing system converges while remaining faithful to the economic incentives of each domain. Dr. Rexford's work with Nick Feamster provided an efficient algorithm for modeling the effects of BGP policy changes on the flow of traffic through a domain. The operators of each domain can use the algorithm to select routing policies that maximize user performance and balance network load. Hence Dr. Rexford's work identified how each domain should constrain its policies to meet the overarching goal of the stability of the Internet, as well as the concrete methods each domain can apply to satisfy its own engineering goals within those constraints.

Recommender systems have become ubiquitous. Whether shopping at Amazon.com, selecting videos at Netflix, or getting news and information, we have become accustomed to sophisticated personalization software that uses our preference data, together with the preference data of others, to provide personalized recommendations for content or products. Automated collaborative filtering, which launched the field of recommender systems in 1994, was introduced, refined, and commercialized by the team of John Riedl, Paul Resnick, Joseph A. Konstan, Neophytos Iacovou, Peter Bergstrom, Mitesh Suchak, Brad Miller, David Maltz, Jon Herlocker, Lee Gordon, Sean McNee, and Shyong (Tony) K. Lam through the GroupLens family of systems. The first generation GroupLens system (1994) was used to create personalized recommendations of Usenet news articles. The second generation (1995-1996) also targeted Usenet news articles, and led to the commercial launch of Net Perceptions, spawning what is now a vibrant recommender systems industry. After commercialization, the team launched MovieLens in 1997. MovieLens, a web-based research platform still operating today, has been used by more than 100,000 users; its online experiments and published datasets have led to hundreds of published advances in the field of recommender systems. Prior to GroupLens, most personalization systems were based entirely on building profiles of content preferences, and then applying them to new content. While this technique worked when interests were topical (e.g., choosing news about a favorite football club), they did not handle less feature-based preferences or distinguish among topical items by quality or taste. In 1992, Xerox PARC's Tapestry project introduced the term and concept \"collaborative filtering\", creating a centralized database where annotations could be stored and retrieved, but application of this idea was limited by the need to manually form queries and explore the database. The GroupLens team introduced automation to the process, which proved to be the fundamental breakthrough that enabled wide-ranging research and commercial applications. Through the founding of Net Perceptions, GroupLens had an enormous impact on e-commerce and information portals. Early customers, including Amazon.com, CDnow, and Art.com, demonstrated that the software generalized to a wide variety of domains, and validated the usefulness of collaborative filtering recommendation through explicit and implicit user ratings . Net Perceptions grew to become a $1 billion company, providing recommender systems to leading retail and information companies around the world. Recommender systems grew into an extensive research field, drawing from machine learning, human computer interaction, ecommerce, information retrieval, databases, and other areas of computer science. ACM's annual Recommender Systems Conference brings together leading researchers and practitioners. The field was recently energized by the $1 million Netflix Challenge. ",

He joined that Department in 1989. His research interests include temporal databases, query language design, query optimization and evaluation, storage structures and database design. Rick was named an ACM Fellow in 1999.  Rick chaired the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD) from 1997 to 2001. As a member of the SIG Governing Board, he led the movement to align the SIGs, both intellectually and financially, behind the goal of broadening the ACM Digital Library into a portal. He argued effectively that adding citation pages for all computing literature to the Digital Library would reap great rewards for ACM, for ACM's members, and for the research community at large. Today, the Digital Library with over 850,000 citation pages, is a gem in the crown of ACM.  Rick's other ACM activities include co-chairing the History Committee, chairing the Publications Board, serving on Council, and chairing the Advisory Board of SIGMOD. He is the current Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Database Systems and has served as an Associate Editor of the International Journal on Very Large Databases and the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.   Rick's conference activities include chairing the Americas program committee for the 2001 VLDB Conference and the program committees for the 1994 SIGMOD Conference and the 1993 International Workshop on an Infrastructure for Temporal Databases. In addition, he has served as a vice-chair or member of many database conference program committees. Rick received the ACM SIGMOD Contribution Award in 2002.

Both are widely cited for seminal work in these areas. Yoav's pioneering work in agent-oriented programming provided a methodology for specifying distributed multi-agent systems, and his work in combinatorial auctions and mechanism design is equally foundational. Moshe created RMax \u0013 one of the best known reinforcement learning algorithms, and introduced the concept of program equilibrium to the analysis of Internet economies.  As collaborators, they have provided foundational contributions to the areas of social coordination, preceding the recent growth of activity in social networks. Their work established a framework for addressing coordination of multiple agents in distributed settings, and established a basis for examining a wide range of important questions and for developing influential applications in electronic commerce, combinatorial auctions, social computing, equilibrium computation, mechanism design, and multi-agent learning. Each has individually won the ACM SIGART Autonomous Agents Research Award for his own contributions to autonomous agents and multiagent systems. Yoav and Moshe have also been influential in other areas. Yoav\u0019s textbook on multi-agent systems (with Kevin Leyton-Brown) is widely praised by key researchers from AI, operations research, philosophy, political science, economics and game theory, biology, and statistics.

McMillan For their invention of symbolic model checking, a method of formally checking system designs, which is widely used in the computer hardware industry and is beginning to show significant promise also in software verification and other areas.   Model checking was invented in 1981 by Clarke and Emerson. This technique made it possible to algorithmically verify logical properties, expressed in a notation called temporal logic, of finite-state systems. Clarke and Emerson were able to use model checking to find some very subtle design errors in published hardware designs. The size of the state space was seriously limited, however, by the amount of available computer memory. In 1985, Bryant developed a new representation of Boolean functions, called OBDDs (Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams). Bryant's crucial contribution was to show that by fixing the order of testing of Boolean variables in binary decision diagrams, these diagrams become very tractable computationally. McMillan then realized that OBDDs can symbolically represent sets of states in state-transition systems. In 1987, he developed a software tool called SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier) with which systems with over 10^20 states could be verified, and symbolic model checking was born.   ",

Dr. Randy Pausch is probably best known for being the driving force behind the innovative virtual worlds programming environment Alice and its pedagogy of \"playful learning.\" Alice lets students develop characters and their behaviors in 3D virtual worlds. Not only college students, but also high school and middle school students, learn to do this remarkably quickly using Alice's intuitive graphical user interface, rather than having to grapple with a textual syntax. Using Alice, he created the highly popular and successful course Building Virtual Worlds, in which students from diverse backgrounds learned to work in interdisciplinary teams to create interactive worlds and experiences. Dr. Pausch worked with his Ph.D. student Caitlin Kelleher in the creation and assessment of Storytelling Alice, in which the base technology was extended to provide support for storytelling to give middle school girls a positive first experience with computer programming. Learning to Program with Alice (2006), which he co-authored with Wanda Dann and Stephen Cooper, is in use in over 250 colleges and universities. In addition to his contributions to the Alice programming environment, and building upon the Building Virtual Worlds course, Dr. Pausch co-founded the Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center. The ETC is co-sponsored by the School of Computer Science and the College of Fine Arts and offers the world's only Master of Entertainment Technology degree. Among his other achievements, Dr. Pausch created SUIT, Simple User Interface Toolkit, and innovated formal user testing for theme park attractions and virtual reality. He tested major theme park attractions at DisneyQuest, EPCOT Center, and Disney's California Adventure. His research with colleagues in cognitive science, perception, and HCI has broken new ground in understanding people's interactions with technology. He inspires our community to be more ambitious, more collaborative, more multi-disciplinary and inclusive, and above all, to be passionate about learning and creating, to live life joyfully and fully engaged. For his tools, pedagogy, mentoring, and inspiration not just to his students and colleagues but to our field, and indeed, through his landmark \"Last Lecture,\" to the world at large, Randy Pausch is an exemplar for the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  ",

Throughout his career, departments, journal boards, technical committees, accreditation processes, curriculum revision initiatives, conferences, workshops, and numerous other professional activities have benefited from his judgment, leadership and energy. Ray Miller has made a career of service to computer science, its institutions and professional associations, the contribution of which is only partially revealed by his becoming a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE and AAAS. He has energetically supported and nurtured the discipline, assisting in the development of an extensive variety of professional and educational bodies while, at the same time, contributing intellectually in areas such as parallel computation, switching theory and fault management. Professor Miller spent 14 years on the ACM Publications Board bringing high standards and leadership to its mission. He edited the Journal of the ACM, and ACM Transactions on Networking, helping to raise the visibility and status of both publications. He was a founder of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB), serving as its initial Vice President and second President, helping, through his statesmanship, to make it a model of inter-society cooperation. Professor Miller participated in the founding and coordination of the Computer Science Board, helping to transform it from an oversight committee for computer science conferences, to an influential representative group that works energetically and effectively to advance computer science research, that is, to the present Computing Research Association (CRA). Given the length of his beneficial career, the breadth of his intellectual and organizational service, and a span of contributions that includes theory and research, science and engineering, and academe and industry, selecting Ray Miller for this ACM Distinguished Service Award is not only judicious, but is also consistent with the highest standards of the Award.

Reinhard Wilhelm has had deep and lasting impact on informatics and computing research through 20 years of effective leadership as Scientific Director of the Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz Center for Informatics in Saarland, Germany. Dagstuhl provides a truly unique research setting for computer scientists, bringing together researchers from complementary areas for week-long intensive workshops that often catalyze new research collaborations and research directions. In the 20-year period between the inception of Schloss Dagstuhl in 1989 until the end of 2010, the Centre has hosted close to 800 seminars and perspective workshops, hundreds of additional events such as summer schools, and over 30,000 guests. The relaxed environment, away from normal distractions, fosters an intensity of engagement among conference participants that is rarely found at other computing research venues. Participants come from all over the world and the relatively low cost has resulted in strong participation by students. As Scientific Director, Dr. Wilhelm's careful stewardship of the scientific program has been pivotal to Dagstuhl's success. He guides the choice of seminar topics, emphasizing seminars that bring together groups with common interests but limited prior contact, and is invariably present on-site to advise seminar organizers. He has also taken the lead in fund-raising, in overseeing major renovations, and in planning a new building. His attention to details, such as the library, the art that graces the buildings, and the adjacent grounds has resulted in environment that is highly conducive to building collegial and productive relationships. In all of these ways, Dr. Wilhelm's contributions to fostering the intellectual health of computing research are unsurpassed. In addition to his service to Schloss Dagstuhl, Dr. Wilhelm has enhanced the reputation of the Computer Science Department at Saarland University through his research and service. Dr. Wilhelm was awarded the 2010 Federal Cross of Merit by the German Government and the 2009 Konrad-Zuse Medal for outstanding contributions in Informatics.  ",

Richard Gabriel has had a wide influence on programming languages and software design, and has also nurtured interaction between computer science and other disciplines. He has stretched the imagination of computer scientists with ideas and innovations from other fields (notably architecture and poetry), shaping the growth and impact of object technology.  Dr. Gabriel contributed to the development of Lisp and other infrastructure used by the artificial intelligence community. His contributions to the definition of the Common Lisp Object System set the stage for many object-oriented language features that were ahead of their time. He helped to develop Smalltalk and other infrastructure used by the object-oriented programming community, and has been influential in the ACM OOPSLA conferences, for which he created the Onward! Track to look for the next big advance in object technology. His paper \"Worse is Better,\" a meditation on programming language design, has been widely circulated and debated by programming language designers.  Dr. Gabriel worked with the Hillside Group to adapt architect Christopher Alexander's notion of patterns and pattern languages to the domain of software engineering. He promoted writers' workshops as a means of capturing this important form of design documentation and developing a pattern community that cares about clear communication. He taught others how to run such workshops, for both poetry and software. He worked with the Computer History Museum to preserve classic software, and harvested design patterns in the process. He promoted industry and open-source communities, including Sun's Jini project. He is leading the development of a prototype Master of Fine Arts program in Software at the University of Illinois.  A 1981 PhD graduate in Computer Science from Stanford University, Dr. Gabriel also earned a MFA in Creative Writing (Poetry) from Warren Wilson College in 1998. He is now a Distinguished Engineer with Sun Microsystems, President of the Hillside Group, and a Principal Investigator at Sun Laboratories.

The Splay-Tree data structure is perhaps the most widely-used data structure developed in the past twenty years. The Splay-Tree data structure is a self-adjusting binary search tree that can be used for example to provide fast access to tables and to implement priority queues. It has several practical and theoretical advantages over previous tree-based approaches to these tasks: (1) Splay Trees are very easy to program, (2) they require no additional data at the nodes and hence are space-efficient, (3) they are able to exploit temporal locality in the request stream, and (4) they provide optimal amortized running time guarantees, with an average cost per request of O(log n). Indeed, the average cost per request is at most a constant times that incurred by the best possible static tree, even if that tree could be chosen in hindsight, after seeing the entire request stream.   Included among the many products and systems that rely on splay trees are the most widely-used implementation of Malloc (the memory allocation scheme used in UNIX systems), the GCC compiler and the GNU C++ libraries to implement priority queues and sets, the UBIQX and CDT libraries for container data types for C and C++, the most widely-used publicly available web proxy cache (SQUID), the Lotus Ami Pro word processor, both the Linux and Windows NT operating systems, and software for switching and routing equipment made by Fore Systems (now part of Marconi) and Lucent Technologies.   Splay Trees, and the new concept of amortized analysis that Sleator and Tarjan introduced to characterize their performance, have also had a major impact on the general field of algorithm design and analysis. The data structure itself is highlighted in almost every modern algorithms text, and amortized analysis has been immensely influential, by showing that algorithms could still have provably good overall performance even when individual steps might occasionally take a long time. Many useful algorithms of this sort have been developed since Sleator and Tarjan introduced the tools for analyzing them.   ",

Rivest and Adi Shamir have been selected for their role in the creation of the world's most widely used public-key cryptography system, which has become known by their initials, RSA.Their work was a significant advance in enabling secure communication among computers using public-key cryptography. Today, the RSA system is used in email systems, web browsers, secure shells, virtual private networks, mobile phones, and in many other applications requiring the secure exchange of information. The RSA algorithm made key management practical in public-key cryptography systems.At the heart of the RSA encryption algorithm is the difficulty of factoring large integers. Factoring an integer involves finding the prime numbers which when multiplied together yield that integer. Despite the efforts of the world's most prominent mathematicians and computer scientists over the centuries, no one has yet found an effective way to factor large integers quickly.To understand how RSA encryption works, suppose Alice and Bob want to communicate secretly without having to worry about Eve eavesdropping on their message exchanges. Alice secretly selects two prime numbers, usually at least one hundred digits long. She multiplies the two primes to create a \"public key\" which she can post on the Internet. If Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice, he fetches Alice's public key from the Internet and enters this key into the algorithm devised by Adleman, Rivest and Shamir to encrypt his message.Here the essence of the RSA scheme manifests itself. Only Alice knows the prime factors that went into the creation of her public key and the RSA algorithm requires the recipient to know both factors to decipher the message. Since Alice chose the two factors, she of course can decrypt Bob's message and read it. Even though Eve can see the encrypted message and Alice's public key, Eve cannot decipher Bob's message so his communication to Alice remains secure.Although the problem of factoring large integers into primes was suspected to be a computationally difficult problem, no one prior to the Adleman, Rivest and Shamir had understood how factoring could be effectively applied to the problem of generating public/private keys in the context of public-key cryptography.

          "citation": " Public-Key Cryptography Leonard Adleman, Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir For the conception and first effective realization of public-key cryptography. The idea of a public-key cryptosystem was a major conceptual breakthrough that continues to stimulate research to this day, and without it today's rapid growth of electronic commerce would have been impossible.   The idea of a public-key cryptosystem was conceived in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, while Rivet, Shamir, and Adleman provided its first effective realization in 1977. The original conception of the idea was a remarkable achievement, as it simultaneously addressed two key security questions: (1) key exchange over insecure communication channels and (2) message authentication. Classical cryptography, also know as private-key cryptography, depends on the ability of legitimate parties to exchange keys without anyone else finding out what the keys are. Previously it had seemed that to do this one needed a secure channel between the parties, something that would be hard to find for an arbitrary pair wishing to communicate over a large public network. Message authentication is the problem of verifying that a given message was sent by the claimed author.  In a public-key cryptosystem as originally envisioned, the encryption keys would come in easy-to-generate pairs such that (1) anything encrypted using one key could be decrypted using the other and (2) given one key, the \"public\" key, it is infeasible to decrypt messages encoded with that key without knowledge of the other \"secret\" key. Using such a system, anyone wishing to receive encrypted messages need only generate a pair of keys and broadcast the public key over the network. Moreover, you can generate a message that demonstrably must come from you simply by encoding it with your secret key. Note also that such a system reduces the potential number of keys needed for N parties to communicate with each other from N^2 to N.   The idea of a public-key cryptosystem was a major conceptual breakthrough that continues to stimulate research to this day, as theoreticians and others attempted to devise such systems, deduce the consequences of their existence, and invent new variants and applications. The first effective realization of its full potential was the \"RSA\" scheme of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, which made crucial use of number theory to provide the encryption and decryption mechanisms. This turned out not only to be a theoretical \"proof in principle\" but also an eminently practical scheme and the one that is still most widely used today.   The use of public-key cryptography \"in practice\" is currently both widespread and rapidly growing. It is now generally recognized that computing and communications technology are merging in a way that makes data available not only to intended recipients, but unintended ones as well. We see this in email and web access where data flowing through many computers is vulnerable to interception. The growth of wireless communications for voice and computer communications leads to greater connectivity, but also to much greater opportunity to intercept data and forge messages. We are moving to a world of high connectivity where each user can see other users' data. The only practical way to maintain privacy and integrity of information is by using public-key cryptography.   The effects of this technology are evident today in a number of products. World Wide Web browsers and servers from Netscape and Microsoft use public- key cryptography for client/server authentication and for key management in support of confidentiality. Standards for secure electronic transactions in the credit card industry embody the use of public-key cryptography, and a wide range of hardware and software products are emerging to support these standards. Products providing email services (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Qualcomm Eudora, Netscape Navigator, etc.) are adding security based on public-key cryptography with release of these mainstream products. Lotus Notes, the most successful groupware products, is an early example of the use of public-key cryptography, since its introduction in the later half of the 1980s.   Today, millions of people are doing home banking and credit-car purchases over the Internet, and both the number of people and the variety of applications are growing rapidly, all made possible by the security offered by public-key cryptography. Indeed, electronic commerce on the Internet would not be possible without the flexible, robust security offered by public-key cryptography. It is reasonable to believe that a decade from now public-key cryptography will be an integral component of all information systems - and their software components - for which integrity of content is essential, for which security of transactions is paramount, for which certainty of user identification is legally required, for which high value (in the dollar sense) events occur electronically. No other single concept in the history of cryptography has been as far reaching.   ",

In 1993, at the Networking Research Laboratory, Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, the recipients designed and implemented the first secure sockets layer, named Secure Network Programming (SNP). Funding for this project was provided by NSA and NSF. SNP, designed as an application sublayer on top of sockets, provides a user interface closely resembling sockets. This resemblance was by design so that security could be retrofitted into existing application programs that use sockets with only minor modifications. SNP's secure sockets support both stream and datagram semantics with security guarantees (i.e., data origin authenticity, data destination authenticity, data integrity, and data confidentiality.) Many of the design choices in SNP can be found in today's secure sockets layer used between browsers and Internet servers, including: placing authenticated communication endpoints in the application layer, use of public key cryptography for authentication, a handshake protocol for establishing session state including a shared secret, use of symmetric key cryptography for data confidentiality, and managing contexts and credentials in the secure sockets layer.

Through a long series of highly creative projects on network security, privacy, and reliability, Stefan has shown how we can and should analyze Internet attacks and attackers as elements of an integrated technological, societal, and economic system. More specifically, Stefan has looked at problems such as spam not purely in technical terms, but also using technical data to understand the economic and social structures underlying the attackers. The hypothesis is that rather than continuing to separately defeat each new threat or attack, our defenses could be much more effective by understanding the \"value chain\" of the adversary -- the relationships and dependencies that the attacker utilizes in order to make the attack successful --and using this knowledge to guide any intervention.

Professor Russell has made many seminal contributions to the field of artificial intelligence research. He is best known for applying rigorous mathematical and quantitative approaches to his formulation of systems that can display intelligent behavior and learn from past experiences. Mathematical logic and probabilistic methods are the cornerstones of his approach to Artificial Intelligence. Professor Russell, after his undergraduate education at Oxford University, received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1986. He joined the Berkeley faculty in that year, where he is now the Smith-Zadeh Professor in Engineering and leads the Center for Intelligent Systems. He has won numerous awards in his field, including the Computers and Thought award in 1995, and is a Fellow of the ACM and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Russell is widely known for creating a dynamic research group among his students and post doctoral researchers, many of whom have gone on to become young leaders in the field. He has supervised the research of over 45 undergraduate students, graduate students, and post docs, who now populate industry, industrial research, and university departments. Russell is an inspirational teacher, teaching both graduate and undergraduate courses in Artificial Intelligence. He has also co-taught an innovative Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science course developed with his theory colleagues at Berkeley. Perhaps Russell's most significant contribution to teaching beyond the classroom is his seminal textbook, written in partnership with Dr. Peter Norvig, and entitled Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.  This book brings Russell's research insights and approach into the classroom, and it has revolutionized the teaching of artificial intelligence around the world. The book is in use in 940 universities in 91 countries, and can rightly be called the premier textbook in the field.  ",

          "citation": " For over twenty years of ACM leadership, including initiatives to increase ACM's international presence and public policy influence, and his tireless devotion to bringing the chapters activities to greater prominence; leading ACM's efforts in computing science accreditation; rewriting Association bylaws and policies; and steering publications projects resulting in improved review processes and more timely publication. Stuart Zweben has served ACM in many capacities since his earliest days of leadership in the Central Ohio Chapter of the ACM, which started over 20 years ago. In the mid 1980s, as Chairman of the Chapters Committee (and later the Chapters Board) he led the Chapters area to greater prominence and effectiveness within the Association.   He has led several activities involving the rewriting of ACM bylaws and policies, including those which led to the downsizing of Council, changes in the structure of the nominating committee, and in the operation and management of chapters. The Association and many of the SIGs are still operating under the revised bylaws and Policies developed during his four-year term as Chairman of the ACM Constitution and Bylaws Committee.   Stuart served as an ACM representative to the Computing Science Accreditation Board (CSAB) for seven years. For four of those years he served as Vice President and President of the Board, helping it achieve viability as an independent accrediting organization as well as increased acceptance within the computing science community. During his term on the Board, CSAB also achieved recognition by the U. S. Department of Education and the Council on Postsecondary Education.   As a member of the Publications Board, Stuart initiated a process for the periodic review of ACM journals intended to provide assessments of current progress and to help formulate potential new directions. He later led an ACM Computing Surveys review team which recommended significant changes resulting in improved editorial content and more timely publication of this important ACM journal.   As Vice President, and then President of ACM, Stuart focused on internationalization and public policy projects. He also worked tirelessly on more internally focused efforts, always serving as the number one advocate for ACM members, and helping to improve communication among volunteers and between volunteers and staff. He was instrumental in guiding new student- oriented initiatives to completion. We now have the student publication Crossroads, an expanded programming contest, and an active student committee with students as its primary membership.   Stuart can look with great pride on the success of other high-profile projects from his administration, most notably ACM97, the ACM 50th Anniversary Celebration, and the Kasparov- Deep Blue Chess match. Yet he would be the first to say that none of these things would have achieved the success they did without the hard work of the entire community of ACM volunteers and staff. His record of service to ACM is substantial, but his appreciation and recognition of the importance of cooperation and of the work of the entire ACM volunteer and staff community is an equally vital legacy to the Association. We can all take great pride in the awarding of the ACM Outstanding Contribution Award to one of our finest models of the ACM Volunteer, Stuart H. Zweben.   ",

Takeo Kanade's contributions to computer vision and robotics balance fundamental theoretical insights with practical, real-world applications. His research covers a remarkable range of areas, including motion detection and analysis, direct drive manipulators, face detection and analysis, three dimensional shape recovery from stereo vision and from motion analysis, video surveillance and monitoring, and many other topics. His results are based on keen algorithmic insights, supported by sound mathematical and physical principles, and rigorous implementation and evaluation of deployed systems. Such applications include medical robots for surgical assistance, \"virtualized reality\" systems for capturing and visualizing three-dimensional scenes, many modern graphical effects in video, and autonomous vehicles and helicopters. Professor Kanade's work is interdisciplinary throughout, drawing on theories and methods from perception, mechanics, kinematics, mathematics, and core computer science. Professor Kanade has played a major leadership role within the field of vision and robotics. From 1991 to 2001, he was the Director of the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon. Under his leadership, the Institute doubled its activities and grew into one of the largest and best-known robotics organizations in the world. He also founded the Robotics Ph.D. Program at Carnegie Mellon in 1989, which has produced a new generation of roboticists who themselves are now leaders in academia, government, and industry throughout the world. In 2001, he founded the Digital Human Research Center in Tokyo, which is dedicated to observing and measuring human functions, developing computer models of these functions, and applying them to the design of human-centered systems. Finally, in July 2006, Professor Kanade established a new NSF-funded Quality of Life Technology Center, jointly with University of Pittsburgh's Rehabilitation Science and Technology Department. All of these organizations bring together researchers from different fields, and serve to bridge interdisciplinary boundaries between them.  ",

Dr. Vern Paxson's PhD dissertation in the mid-1990s laid the groundwork for the exciting resurgence in research in Internet measurement during the last ten years. Through a series of highly influential papers, Dr. Paxson not only provided a wealth of useful information about the nature of the deployed Internet, but also raised the practice of network measurement to an entirely new level by combining the extensive collection of data from many locations with sophisticated statistical techniques. His findings about the Internet, and most importantly the mismatches between reality and the assumptions commonly made in analytical and simulation models, led the networking community to place much greater emphasis on the collection and analysis of measurement data as a major part of the research process. Dr. Paxson's SIGCOMM'94 paper on \"Wide-area traffic: The failure of Poisson modeling\" (co-authored with Sally Floyd) showed definitively that the (then common) practice of modeling packet and connection arrivals as a Poisson process significantly underestimates the burstiness of real Internet traffic. His SIGCOMM'96 paper on \"End-to-end routing behavior in the Internet\" analyzed more than 40,000 measurements between 37 Internet sites to study pathological routing behavior, such as instability, loops, and outages, and demonstrated how to draw meaningful statistical inferences from indirect observations of the Internet's routing system. This paper recently won SIGCOMM's first \"test of time\" award, given to the most influential networking paper written ten years ago. Dr. Paxson's SIGCOMM'97 paper on \"End-to-end internet packet dynamics\" analyzed 20,000 bulk file transfers between 35 Internet sites to study the frequency and effects of path asymmetry, out-of-order packet delivery, packet corruption, and packet-loss patterns, including the important finding that loss events have much more complex statistical structure than previously thought. Dr. Paxson's PhD thesis -- a tome at over 400 pages -- is one of the only dissertations that was (and still is) widely read by other researchers in the networking community. His early measurement papers are still widely cited, and his style of research adopted as a gold standard for how to measure a complex, heterogeneous network like the Internet and make statistically sound statements about its properties and their implications. The vibrancy of the Internet Measurement Conference (which he co-created in 2001) and the prevalence of measurement papers at other networking conferences are a testament to the influence of his initial research in this area.

Since its open source release in 2003, LLVM has become widely used in both commercial products and for computer science research.  LLVM is a persistent, language-independent program representation based on static single assignment (SSA) form that enables code analysis and transformation, including compile time, link time, and run time optimizations, for arbitrary programming languages. The openness of the LLVM technology and the quality of its architecture and engineering design are key factors in understanding the success it has had both in academia and industry. Due to its clean and flexible design and easy to use programming interfaces, LLVM has quickly replaced GCC as the infrastructure of choice for doing research on program translation, optimization, and analysis. Researchers routinely use it for projects as diverse as building link-time interprocedural optimizers, just-in-time compilers, secure browser extensions, language virtual machines, static analysis tools, automatic vectorization, GPU programming, software verification, hardware synthesis tools, embedded code generators, and numerous language implementations. In the years since its release, LLVM has been incorporated into commercial products by Apple, Adobe, AMD, Arxan, AutoESL, Cray, Google, Intel, National Instruments, nVidia, REAL Software, XMOS, and many others. LLVM has completely replaced GCC as the primary compiler in the latest OS X and iOS systems, so that every newly compiled application for Apple devices is compiled with LLVM. LLVM has also had significant commercial impact by enabling the design and implementation of powerful graphics languages like OpenCL and Renderscript. Every commercial implementation of OpenCL (e.g., from AMD, Apple, Intel and nVidia) is based on LLVM. All recent Android devices ship with LLVM to compile graphics code written in Renderscript.  ",

Professor William A. Wulf (Bill Wulf) has made extraordinary contributions to both the computing and engineering research communities as well as to education and public policy. He is the only computer scientist to have served in both of the most important and visible national leadership positions in computing and engineering in the United States: as Assistant Director (AD) of NSF's Computer and Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate from 1988 to 1990 and as President of the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) from 1997 to 2007. Professor Wulf's time as AD of CISE was marked by his great understanding of the role NSF played in supporting science and engineering in the United States. As a \"young\" Directorate (CISE was created in 1986), he led the alignment of the missions and domains of the CISE and the Engineering Directorates - a difficult subject that was helped by his keen understanding of these two domains. This was an important period for CISE, for not only was it responsible for funding basic research in computer science and engineering in the US, but also for operating a half-dozen supercomputer centers and NREN (aka NSFNet). A highlight of his tenure at NSF was overseeing the merger and conversion of ARPANet with/to NREN, a critical step that eventually evolved into a network accessible to and usable by all - the Internet.  Professor Wulf has also been widely recognized for his leadership in engineering and for his advocacy of engineering education and technical literacy while president of the NAE. He established the NAE standing committee on engineering education which produced the influential reports The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century and Educating the Engineer of 2020: Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century. He conceived of and promoted NAE's tech literacy movement including a seminal report that made the case for technical literacy, Technically Speaking: Why All Americans Need to Know More About Technology. This in turn led to NAE's efforts to understand the role and potential for teaching engineering concepts at the K-12 level. He also created the Center on Engineering, Ethics and Society (CEES) in NAE to discuss the importance of ethics in the profound impact of engineering on our society.  Professor Wulf's distinguished service and leadership, at both the NSF and the NAE, has helped to shape the future for computer and engineering practitioners, researchers, educators and public policy makers.

The ACM Outstanding Contribution Award is presented to ACM Fellow Zvi Kedem in recognition for his leadership as Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) 2012 Update Project. The CCS has been the de facto standard taxonomy for the computing field for over 50 years. The last major overhaul of the CCS was released in January 1982 under the leadership of Jean E. Sammet and Anthony Ralston. After four minor updates in (the last in 1998), in 2011 Kedem undertook a massive project to revise and automate the CCS, rebuilding it as a modern cognitive map of the computing field. He delineated 13 subject areas, which defined the nature of work teams for developing those areas. He recruited 13 team leaders, who in turn recruited 134 subject domain experts, including among them 39 ACM Fellows and three ACM Distinguished Members. He coordinated the year-long efforts of this expansive pool of talent in critiquing and thoroughly revising an initial draft of the new CCS which had been generated by an ACM contractor with expertise in developing ontologies using automated methods. With Zvi Kedem'\u0019s broad knowledge of the computing space, he was able to resolve thorny conceptual differences among the team leaders. The CCS is a unique and key component of the search index infrastructure underlying the ACM Digital Library and ACM Guide to Computing Literature. In providing a structured set of computing concepts, it enables discovery of both topic-specific works and of people with subject-specific expertise. The CCS infrastructure is now in place and its effects will be seen throughout the ACM Digital Library, in Citation Pages for individual works, in ACM Author Profiles, and in all aggregated views of the field, including Institutional Profiles, Conference and Journal views, and descriptions of ACM Special Interest Groups.
