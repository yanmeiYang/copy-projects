Considering that we also need alternatives to oil, an opportunity exists to extract liquid fuels or even industrial solvents from these abundant wastes. Anaerobic undefined mixed cultures can handle the complexity and variability of organic wastes, which produces carboxylates that can be efficiently converted to useful bioproducts. However, to date, barriers, such as inefficient liquid product separation and persistence of methanogens, have prevented the production of bioproducts other than methane. Here, we discuss combinations of biological and chemical pathways that comprise the ‘carboxylate platform’, which is used to convert waste to bioproducts. To develop the carboxylate platform into an important system within biorefineries, we must understand the kinetic and thermodynamic possibilities of anaerobic pathways, understand the ecological principles underlying pathway alternatives, and develop superior separation technologies."

Nelson and Winter helped revive this interest in the work of Michael Polanyi by using the idea of tacit knowledge to inform their analysis of routines and evolutionary dynamics of technological change. More recently, the concept has received closer scrutiny. This paper offers a further contribution to this project by offer- ing a critical analysis of the prevailing implicit and explicit economic geographies of tacit knowledge, focusing on the relationship between tacit knowledge and institutions. While much of the innovation literature focuses on a single question ^ can tacit knowledge be effectively shared over long distances ^ the paper argues that this issue cannot be properly addressed without considering a broader range of related questions. It highlights three tacit knowledge problems which, together, provide a more complete view of this issue. First, how is tacit knowledge produced? Second, how do firms find and appropriate tacit knowledge? Third, how is tacit knowledge repro- duced or shared ^ that is, how does tacit knowledge promote social learning processes, and must the participants be geographically proximate in order for effective learning to occur? The paper revisits Michael Polanyi's original conception of tacit knowledge, showing it to be limited by its experi- ential and cognitive emphasis, with insufficient attention devoted to the role and origins of social context. Alternatively, the paper argues that one cannot sort out the geography of tacit knowledge without inquiring into the founda- tions of context and culture, and the institutional underpinnings of economic activity, taking the work of another Polanyi ^ Karl ^ as the logical starting point."

        "abstract": "Three hundred cDNAs containing putatively entire open reading frames (ORFs) for previously undefined genes were obtained from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), based on EST cataloging, clone sequencing, in silico cloning, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their ORFs coded for peptides of 58-752 amino acids. Public database search indicated that 225 cDNAs exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species. Homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structural motifs/domains among these cDNAs. Genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cDNA data with genome sequence information. Interestingly, a new gene named as HSPC070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3 UTR with RAF gene in reversed transcription orientation. Chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid (RH) for 38 genes. Macroarray technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in five hematopoietic cell lines (NB4, HL60, U937, K562, and Jurkat) and a number of genes with differential expression were found. The resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic DNA sequence, but also for further research on the function of genes involved in hematopoietic development and differentiation."

      "abstract": "Three hundred cDNAs containing putatively entire open reading frames (ORFs) for previously undefined genes were obtained from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), based on EST cataloging, clone sequencing, in silico cloning, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their ORFs coded for peptides of 58-752 amino acids. Public database search indicated that 225 cDNAs exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species. Homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structural motifs/domains among these cDNAs. Genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cDNA data with genome sequence information. Interestingly, a new gene named as HSPC070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3 UTR with RAF gene in reversed transcription orientation. Chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid (RH) for 38 genes. Macroarray technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in five hematopoietic cell lines (NB4, HL60, U937, K562, and Jurkat) and a number of genes with differential expression were found. The resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic DNA sequence, but also for further research on the function of genes involved in hematopoietic development and differentiation.",

        "abstract": "We present Memcheck, a tool that has been implemented with the dynamic binary instrumentation framework Valgrind. Memcheck detects a wide range of memory errors in programs as they run. This paper focuses on one kind of error that Memcheck detects: undefined value errors. Such errors are common, and often cause bugs that are hard to find in programs written in languages such as C, C++ and Fortran. Memcheck's definedness checking improves on that of previous tools by being accurate to the level of individual bits. This accuracy gives Memcheck a low false positive and false negative rate. The definedness checking involves shadowing every bit of data in registers and memory with a second bit that indicates if the bit has a defined value. Every value-creating operation is instrumented with a shadow operation that propagates shadow bits appropriately. Memcheck uses these shadow bits to detect uses of undefined values that could adversely affect a program's behaviour. Under Memcheck, programs typically run 20-30 times slower than normal. This is fast enough to use with large programs. Memcheck finds many errors in real programs, and has been used during the past two years by thousands of programmers on a wide range of systems, including OpenOffice, Mozilla, Opera, KDE, GNOME, MySQL, Perl, Samba, The GIMP, and Unreal Tournament."

However, a recent report suggested that this interaction is driven by amygdala deactivation during presentation of neutral stimuli in s carriers.Functional MRI was used to assess amygdala activation during the presentation of a fixation cross or affectively aversive or neutral visual stimuli in 29 healthy men.Amygdala activation was increased in s carriers during undefined states such as the presentation of a fixation cross compared with emotionally neutral conditions.This finding suggests that s carriers show stronger amygdala reactivity to stimuli and contexts that are relatively uncertain, which we propose are stressful."

However,\n a subset of melanomas fail to be lysed by these T cells. In the present report, four different HLA-A*0201+ melanoma cell lines not lysed by melanoma-reactive allogeneic CTL have been evaluated in detail. All four are deficient in\n expression of the melanocytic differentiation proteins (MDP) tyrosinase, Pmel17/gp100, gp75/trp-1, and MART-1/Melan-A. This\n concordant loss of multiple MDP explains their resistance to lysis by melanoma-reactive allogeneic CTL and confirms that a\n subset of melanomas may be resistant to tumor vaccines directed against multiple MDP-derived epitopes. All four melanoma lines\n expressed normal levels of HLA-A*0201, and all were susceptible to lysis by xenoreactive-peptide-dependent HLA-A*0201-specific\n CTL clones, indicating that none had identifiable defects in antigen-processing pathways. Despite the lack of shared MDP-derived\n antigens, one of these MDP-negative melanomas, DM331, stimulated an effective autologous CTL response in vitro, which was\n restricted to autologous tumor reactivity. MHC-associated peptides isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from HLA-A1 and\n HLA-A2 molecules of DM331 tumor cells included at least three peptide epitopes recognized by DM331 CTL and restricted by HLA-A1\n or by HLA-A*0201. Recognition of these CTL epitopes cannot be explained by defined, shared melanoma antigens; instead, unique\n or undefined antigens must be responsible for the autologous-cell-specific anti-melanoma response. These findings suggest\n that immunotherapy directed against shared melanoma antigens should be supplemented with immunotherapy directed against unique\n antigens or other undefined antigens, especially in patients whose tumors do not express MDP."

A stack trace produced on such a crash identifies the effect of the unusable value, not its cause, and is often not much help to the programmer. This paper presents efficient origin tracking of unusable values; it shows how to record where these values come into existence, correctly propagate them, and report them if they cause an error. The key idea is value piggybacking: when the original program stores an unusable value, value piggybacking instead stores origin information in the spare bits of the unusable value. Modest compiler support alters the program to propagate these modified values through operations such as assignments and comparisons. We evaluate two implementations: the first tracks null pointer origins in a JVM, and the second tracks undefined value origins in a memory-checking tool built with Valgrind. These implementations show that origin tracking via value piggybacking is fast and often useful, and in the Java case, has low enough overhead for use in a production environment."

Modest compiler support alters the program to propagate these modified values through operations such as assignments and comparisons. We evaluate two implementations: the first tracks null pointer origins in a JVM, and the second tracks undefined value origins in a memory-checking tool built with Valgrind. These implementations show that origin tracking via value piggybacking is fast and often useful, and in the Java case, has low enough overhead for use in a production environment.",

To reason about unstable code, this paper proposes a novel model, which views unstable code in terms of optimizations that leverage undefined behavior.

There are various equivalent characterisations of this property of terms. We attempt to find a similar notion for orthogonal term rewrite systems. We find that in general the properties of terms analogous to the various characterisations of solvabil- ity differ. We give two axioms that a notion of undefinedness should satisfy, and explore some of their consequences. The axioms lead to a concept analogous to the BShm trees of the A-calculus. Each term has a unique B5hm tree, and the set of such trees forms a domain which provides a denotational semantics for the rewrite system. We consider several particular notions of undefinedness satisfying the axioms, and compare them."
