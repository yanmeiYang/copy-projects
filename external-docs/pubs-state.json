    "abstract": "â–  In its early stages, the field of AI had as its main goal the invention of computer programs having the general problem-solving abilities of humans. Along the way, a major shift of emphasis devel- oped from general-purpose programs toward per- formance programs, ones whose competence was highly specialized and limited to particular areas of expertise. In this article, I claim that AI is now at the beginning of another transition, one that will reinvigorate efforts to build programs of gen- eral, humanlike competence. These programs will use specialized performance programs as tools, much like humans do.",
